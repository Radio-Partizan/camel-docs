h2. Discussion Forums

Before posting you might want to read the [Tips for getting help|http://activemq.apache.org/tips-for-getting-help.html].

Many users prefer to use online forums rather than joining a mail list which can lead to lots more email traffic so we use the online forums at [Nabble forums|http://www.nabble.com/Apache-Camel-f22882.html] which also work with our [Mailing Lists] so that both stay completely in sync. Use either the mailing lists or online forums, its completely up to you.

{info:title=Must be a subscriber when posting on forum}
You have to be a subscriber of the [Camel mailinglist|Mailing Lists] to be able to post on the user forum (Nabble) and have those posts forwarded to the Camel mailinglist. It's on the Camel mailinglist where all the experts is listening and will be able to help you. If you are *not* a subscriber your post will not be forwarded and thus most people will not see your post.

If you use Google Mail then it's easy to setup a rule which can move mails from the mailinglist into a 'Camel user' label. This way its easy to organize your mailbox.

h3. Positing from Nabble
Are you really a subscriber? When you see the big warning, then make sure you have subscriber to the mailinglist. Otherwise the mails is not forwarded. All the experts and people from the community do not browse Nabble and therefore a big chance nobody will be able to help you.
