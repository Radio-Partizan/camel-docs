h2. Camel Dynamic Routes

Student: Xueqiang Mi <alloyer AT gmail DOT com>
Mentor: Jonathan Anstey <janstey AT apache DOT org>

h3. Project Description

We can already modify XML at runtime; we could do with visualizations using Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Python so that folks can view & edit the routes in whatever language they want and hack them. For more see the [Web Console] which supports updating the routes at runtime using the XML structure.

To do this we'll need to be able to turn a RouteDefinition back into the DSLs - such as Groovy/Ruby/Scala/Python

h3. Status


h4. Week of May 11 - May 17, 2009

* Try most of the test cases of camel-core

h4. Weeks of May 23 - June 7, 2009

* Learn the camel-web component and the RESTful WS tool: Jersey................finished
* Do a rough prototype which supports Groovy expression.............................finished
** A prototype is implemented and support creating routes by using Groovy language. We can use the face as follows to create a route on Camel.
** [http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1391f4s9wmhf]
** Now the Camel-web module depends on Camel-groovy module.
* Submit the late design document, expected previously................................finished

h4. Week of June 8 - June 14, 2009

* Improve Groovy Route Editor
* Do Ruby route editing support.......................................................finished
** The editor form now support creating routes by using Ruby language. We can use the face as follows to create a route on Camel.
** [http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1393gczgfzgp]
** Now the Camel-web module depends on Camel-ruby module.
* Do some modification on Xml Route editor if needed...................................canceled
* Do the Groovy style view of route.(Now the editor can only support creating operation, but has no idea how to display a route in GroovyRouteBuilder style).........canceled
* Commit a camel-web-20090611 patch, which contains the Groovy and Ruby route editing support......finished

h4. Week of June 15 - June 21, 2009

* [http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1389]
* [http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1392]

h4. Week of June&nbsp;22 - June 27, 2009

* [http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1392]. It's a little complex to translate the RouteDefinition into GroovyRouteBuilder, so in this week&nbsp;I still work at it.
* [http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1396cnhrwzmf]
* [http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1398w9jt74hf]
* Now the groovyRenderer can support most of the EIP route definitions. It can generate a overview of the route definition, but can't support Expression. Current XML editor also has this problem, it just replace the expression definition with a <expressionDefinition/> element.

* I want to solve it through digging into the ExpressionNode and ExpressionDefinition level, but after a lot of work and test, I found it so difficult because in ExpressionDefinnition, some Groovy closures are embedded in and hard to restore to the original states. I will post some of my experiments on mailing list for discusses.

h4. Week of June&nbsp;28 - July 6, 2009

* Improve the groovyRenderer.
* Do plenty of test (test cases of org.apache.camel.processor in camel-core).
* [http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1400hgqpt3cg] test records: lines not with a prefixion "#" have been supported.

h4. Week of July 7 - July 13, 2009

* Add test cases for groovy renderer.
* https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1804. A user guide for groovy renderer to show how to use, what DSL features are supported, and any know holes.

h4. Week of July 14 - July 19, 2009

* Write the user guide of groovy renderer.
* Improve the code of groovy renderer, to reduce some hard code in it, especially for the Expression Definition processing.
* https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1839

h4. Week of July 20 - July 24, 2009

* Continue to add some DSL test cases.
* Add DSLs' related content into the user guide.

h4. Week of July 25 - Aug 1, 2009

* Go on a vacation.

h4. Week of Aug 3 - Aug 9, 2009

* Add AOP, OnCompletion, OnException and ReSequence DSL support.............finished
* Add interceptFrom, interceptSendToEndpoint DSL support....................finished
* Implement renderRoutes method for groovy renderer.........................finished
* List the supported DSL parameters in [Groovy Renderer User Guide]

h4. Week of Aug 10 - Aug 16, 2009

* Add some DSL support
* Review and improve all the DSL
* Improve predicateRenderer to support all the predicate DSL
* Complete [Groovy Renderer User Guide]
* Do a camel-web example to show how to change business flows by using runtime route modification 

h4. Week of Aug 17 - Aug 24, 2009

* Add several samples to show off the functionalities of groovy renderer
** [Content Based Routing on Camel] shows how to define you processor and invoke it through [Web Console]. It also shows how to define [Content Based Router] on [Web Console].
** [Load Balance for Existing Messaging Service] gives a sample at first and adds [Load Balancer] for it.
* Clean up the related document for final evaluation
** Add several screen shots for [Groovy Renderer User Guide] to present how to edit a route on [Web Console].
* Submit all the deliverables before Aug 19
