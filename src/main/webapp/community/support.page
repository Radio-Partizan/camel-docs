h2. Getting Help

If you are experiencing problems using Camel then please report your problem to our [Discussion Forums] this allows the entire community to help with your problem. If indeed a bug or issue has been identified in the Camel software then report a ticket in the [Issue Tracker|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL]. Please refrain from creating a ticket immediately in the issue tracker, unless you are certain its an issue in the Camel software. If you are in doubt we appreciate using the [Discussion Forums] first.

h3. How to get help

Before you report a problem you might want to read the [FAQ]. 
Whenever you are reporting a problem please be sure to include as much information as possible; the more we know the more chance of a quicker resolution.

* *which version of the software*
* what platform and JDK?
* any particulary container being used - if so what version
* stack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It's very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.
* log output can be useful too; sometimes [enabling DEBUG logging|How do I change the logging] can help
* your code & configuration files are often useful
* did it work before, what have you changed to break it
* try upgrading to the latest release and see if its fixed in that release
* try the latest SNAPSHOT to see if its fixed in that release
* search the user forum to see if has been discussed before
* see the knowns issues section in the release notes
* and check the [issue tracker|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL] if the issue already have been reported

h3. How to get help faster

We can help you much quicker if you try the following

* provide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you've found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug?
* [submit a patch|http://activemq.apache.org/contributing.html] fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes :) )
* for memory leak or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the output as a file (or zipped file if it's huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. e.g. you could run [jmap|http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/share/jmap.html]/[jhat|http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jhat.html], JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks it's quicker to resolve if you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out what's wrong from that.
