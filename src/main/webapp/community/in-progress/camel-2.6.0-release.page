h2. New and Noteworthy

Welcome to the 2.6.0 release which approx XXX issues resolved (new features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Fixed issue in OSGi with refreshing Camel bundles causing a race condition when discovering type converters
* Introduced [ScheduledRoutePolicy] with the [Quartz] component
* Java DSL [RouteBuilder] now fails if {{onException}} and the likes are not configured before routes, which they must.
* Easier to debug routes from {{camel-test}} using the [Debugger]
* Fixed problem installing {{camel-cxf}} feature on Apache Karaf.
* The [EIP] now supports [property placeholders|Properties] in the {{String}} based options (a few spots in Java DSL where its not possible). For example: {code:xml}<convertBodyTo type="String" charset="{{foo.myCharset}}"/>{code} 
* Introduced [ScheduledRoutePolicy] to allow you to schedule when routes should be active.
* Introduced {{stepwise}} option to [FTP|FTP2] component to allow end users to control how to traverse directories of the FTP servers. This allows you to set {{stepwise=false}} to return back to the behavior from Camel 2.0 - 2.4. See more at the [FTP|FTP2] documentation.
* [Thread names|Threading Model] now outputs [CamelContext] name which makes it easier to differentiate when running multiple Camel applications in the same JVM.
* Introduced {{contentCache}} option to [XSLT] component to allow easy reloading of stylesheets during development.
