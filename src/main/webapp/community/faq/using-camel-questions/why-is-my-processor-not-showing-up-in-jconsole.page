h2. Why is my processor not showing up in JConsole

Not every processor is managed and thus not all is visible in the JConsole.

A processor must implement the {{org.apache.camel.Service}} to be managed. Most EIP processors does this.
For example the minor ones such as {{setHeader}} does not and thus is not visible in JConsole.
