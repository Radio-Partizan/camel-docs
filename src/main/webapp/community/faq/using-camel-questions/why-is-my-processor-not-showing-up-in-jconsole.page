h2. Why is my processor not showing up in JConsole

Not every processor is managed and thus not all is visible in the JConsole.

A processor must implement the {{org.apache.camel.Service}} to be managed. Most EIP processors does this.
For example the minor ones such as {{setHeader}} does not and thus is not visible in JConsole.

From *Camel 2.6* onwards your custom {{Processor}} should use the Spring JMX annotations. Just add {{@ManagedResource}} to the class, and the other annotations for the attributes and operations. Then Camel will automatic use those when the processor is being registered in JMX.

The same applies when using beans in your routes.
