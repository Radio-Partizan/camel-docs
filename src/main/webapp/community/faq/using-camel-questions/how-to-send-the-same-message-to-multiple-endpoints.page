h2. How to send the same message to multiple endpoints

When you need to send the *same* message to multiple endpoints then you should use [Multicast].

In the sample below we consume messages from the activemq queue {{foo}} and want to send the *same message* to both {{seda:foo}} and {{seda:bar}}. Sending the same message requires that we use [Multicast]. This is done by adding the {{multicast()}} before the to type:
{code:java}
from("activemq:queue:foo").multicast().to("seda:foo", "seda:bar");
{code}

{tip:title=Pipeline is default in Camel}
If you have a route such as:
{code:java}
from("activemq:queue:foo").to("seda:foo", "seda:bar");
{code}
It is default a [pipeline|Pipes and Filters] in Camel (that is the opposite to [Multicast]). In the above example using pipes and filters then the result from seda:foo is sent to seda:bar, ie. its not the *same* message sent to multiple destinations, but a sent through a chain (the pipes and the filters).
