h2. How do I disable JMX?

You can disable JMX instrumentation agent by setting Java VM system property as follow. The property value is treated as boolean.
{code}
-Dorg.apache.camel.jmx.disabled=true
{code}
Or, by adding a jmxAgent element inside the camelContext element in Spring configuration:
{code}
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <jmxAgent id="agent" disabled="true"/>
    ...
</camelContext>
{code}
Or in Camel 2.1 its a bit easier (not having to use JVM system property) if using pure Java as you can disable it as follows:
{code}
CamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
camel.disableJMX();
{code}
