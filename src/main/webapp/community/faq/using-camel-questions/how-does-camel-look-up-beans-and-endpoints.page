h2. How does Camel look up beans, components or endpoints?

There are many times using Camel that a name is used for a bean such as using the [Bean] endpoint or using the [Bean Language] to create a [Expression] or [Predicate] or referring to any [Component] or [Endpoint].

Camel uses the [Registry] to resolve names when looking up beans or components or endpoints. Typically this will be [Spring]; though you can use Camel without Spring in which case it will use the [JNDI] registry implementation.

Lots of test cases in the camel-core module don't use Spring (as camel-core explicitly doesn't depend on spring) - though test cases in camel-spring do.

So you can just define beans, components or endpoints in your [Registry] implementation then you can refer to them by name in the [Endpoint] URIs or [Bean] endpoints or [Bean Language] expressions.
