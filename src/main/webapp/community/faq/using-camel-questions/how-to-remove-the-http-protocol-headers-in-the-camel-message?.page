In camel there are lots of components use the http protocol headers to do their business.
The components include camel-http, camel-jetty, camel-restlet, camel-cxf etc. 
So if you are using these component, you may pay attention to the Http protocol headers:
{code}
  Exchange.CONTENT_ENCODING
  Exchange.CONTENT_TYPE
  Exchange.HTTP_BASE_URI
  Exchange.HTTP_CHARACTER_ENCODING
  Exchange.HTTP_METHOD
  Exchange.HTTP_PATH
  Exchange.HTTP_QUERY
  Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE
{code}
  
If you don't want these headers bother your other endpoints, you'd better to remove these headers like these
{code}
  from("jetty://http://myhost:9000/myservice/")
    // Remove the header which name is start with CamelHttp, this DSL is new to Camel 2.3.0
    // You can use removeHeader if your camel version is lower than 2.3.0
    .removeHeaders("CamelHttp*")
    .to("otherEndpoint");
{code}

{code}
  <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="jetty://http://myhost:9000/myservice/"/>
	<!-- remove the header of Content-Length -->
	<removeHeader headerName="Content-Length" />
      <to uri="otherEndpoint"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext> 
{code}
