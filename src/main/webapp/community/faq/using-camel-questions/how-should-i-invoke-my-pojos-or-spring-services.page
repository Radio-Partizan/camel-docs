h2. How should I invoke my POJOs or Spring Services?

The various options are described in detail in [Bean Integration], in particular the [Bean Binding] describes how we invoke a bean inside a route

See the [POJO Consuming] for examples using either the *@Consume* annotation or using the routing DSL

{code}
from("jms:someQueue").bean(MyBean.class, "someMethod");
{code}
