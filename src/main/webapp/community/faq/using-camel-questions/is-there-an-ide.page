h2. Is there an IDE for editing Camel routes?

There's not yet an eclipse specific Camel plugin - but we're working on it.

Until a nice graphical IDE is available, you could use your Java IDE for smart completion when creating [Java routing rules|Routes] via the [DSL] which will give you smart completion in Java code.

Or you can use your XML IDE (with XSD smart completion) to edit the [routing rules in XML|Spring] using the [Xml Configuration]
