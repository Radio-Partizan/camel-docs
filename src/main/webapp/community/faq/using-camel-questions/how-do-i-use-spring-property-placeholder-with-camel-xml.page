h2. How do I use Spring Property Placeholder with Camel XML

We don't yet support the {{$\{something}}} notation inside arbitrary Camel XML. For example at the time of writing this is not supported

{code}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
       http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd
    ">

  <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"/>

  <camelContext xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from ref="activemq:${someQueueName}"/>
      <to uri="mock:results"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>


</beans>
{code}

However you can use the *<endpoint/>* element to define endpoints which does support the property resolving which you can then refer to by name or reference in XML or Java code.

{code}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
       http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd
    ">

  <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"/>

  <camelContext xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <endpoint id="input1" uri="activemq:${someQueueName}"/>

    <route>
      <from ref="input1"/>
      <to uri="activemq:OutputQueue"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>


</beans>
{code}

Camel does not yet fully support property placeholders as there is a limitation in Spring. See JIRA [SPR-4466|http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4466]

Here is a trick that you can use to define the uri in a property file using Spring injection and Camel endpoint : http://cmoulliard.blogspot.com/2009/05/trick-to-pass-uri-declared-in-property.html

From Camel 2.3 onwards there is a [Properties] component build in Camel core which allows you to use properties in the same way as Spring property placeholders, and even more.
