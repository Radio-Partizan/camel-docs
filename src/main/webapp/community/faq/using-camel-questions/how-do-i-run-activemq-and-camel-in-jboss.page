h2. How do I run ActiveMQ and Camel in JBoss

A user had a problem with running ActiveMQ embedded inside JBoss. He reported his findings on the Camel mailing list which you can read about [his solution here|http://www.nabble.com/JBoss-%2B-ActiveMQ-%2B-Camel-%2B-Newbie-td24056976.html]. 

h3. Using Camel in JBoss 
*Available as of Camel 2.1*

We have now created a [camel-jboss] component which allows you to run Camel inside JBoss. Unfortunately JBoss uses LGPL license which is Apache unfriendly so the project is hosted at [Camel Extra|http://camel-extra.googlecode.com/]. 

Basically what you need is to use a specialized classloader due to JBoss classloading challenges. This classloder is provided in the [camel-jboss] component.
