h2. What jars do I need?

Camel is designed to be small lightweight and extremely modular so that you only pay for what you use. The core of camel, *camel-core.jar* is small and has minimal dependencies.

On Java 6 camel-core.jar only depends on *commons-logging.jar*. 

On Java 5 camel-core.jar depends also on *activation.jar* and a JAXB2 implementation which typically involves *jaxb-api.jar*, *jaxb-impl.jar* and a StAX API which may be *stax-api.jar and *woodstox.jar*

h3. Using Spring

If you wish to work with Spring, you will also need *camel-spring.jar* along with the *spring.jar* or the individual spring jars if you prefer.

h3. Other components

For other components you may want to look at the [maven reports|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/] to see the exact dependencies of individual modules. 

For example to work with JMS you will require the JMS API jar together with *camel-jms.jar* and your JMS provider of choice such as the [ActiveMQ|http://activemq.apache.org/] [required jars|http://activemq.apache.org/initial-configuration.html]
