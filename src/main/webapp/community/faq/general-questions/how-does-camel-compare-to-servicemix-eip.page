h2. How does Camel compare to ServiceMix EIP

[ServiceMix EIP|http://servicemix.apache.org/servicemix-eip.html] was the ancestor though they both do similar things. 

The main difference with ServiceMix EIP is its integrated into the existing ServiceMix XBean XML configuration whereas Camel has more [Enterprise Integration Patterns] and can be used outside of JBI (e.g. just with pure [JMS] or [MINA]). Also Camel supports a [Java DSL|DSL] or [XML configuration|Spring].

h3. Converting from ServiceMix EIP to Camel

Here's an example of a servicemix-eip route

{code}
<eip:message-filter service="test:messageFilter" endpoint="endpoint">
  <eip:target>
    <eip:exchange-target service="test:trace3" />
  </eip:target>
  <eip:filter>
    <eip:xpath-predicate xpath="count(/test:world) = 1" namespaceContext="#nsContext"/>
  </eip:filter>
</eip:message-filter>
{code}
 
Here's the equivalent Camel code in XML

{code}
<route>
  <from uri="jbi:endpoint:test:messageFilter:endpoint">
  <filter>
   <xpath>count(/test:world) = 1</xpath>
   <to uri="jbi:service:test:trace3"/>
  </filter>
</route>
{code}

Or Java

{code}
from("jbi:endpoint:test:messageFilter:endpoint").
  filter(ns.xpath("count(/test:world) = 1")).
  to("jbi:service:test:trace3");
{code}
