h2. Is it possible to start Camel as a standalone application, without embedding it in another application?

Yes Camel can run standalone or in any container. Running Standalone is as simple just to create a [CamelContext], add routes and start it. If you don't want to write your own java main, you could use the one from [camel-spring|Spring] ([http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-spring/apidocs/]) also used by the [Camel Maven Plugin].

The starting guide is a good place to start:
[Getting Started]

And the concrete walk through a plain old java main example:
[Walk through an Example]

The FAQ have some more details:

And if you use Maven for your projects Camel has maven tools to boot up in standalone mode and quickly run you Camel application:
[Camel Maven Plugin]

This is how you can run the [Examples] that is included in the Camel distribution.
In Camel 1.4 we will also have ANT build.xml files to quickly start the examples standalone.
