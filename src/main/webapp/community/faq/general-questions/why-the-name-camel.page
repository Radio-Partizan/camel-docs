h2. Why did you choose the name Camel

* it stands for Concise Application Message Exchange Language (i.e. the Java [DSL] for routing)
* a Camel can carry [4 times the load|http://www.fao.org/sd/EGdirect/EGan0006.htm ] of other beasts of burden
* a Camel can travel for great distances without water; similarly a Camel does not require bucket loads of XML as you can use a pure Java [DSL]
* some members of the team used to love Camel cigarettes!
* its short, simple and easy to remember name
* very fast, even when the going gets tough!
* a Camel will never spit on those it loves!
* a Camel is not an [evolutionary dead end|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_animals#Equid_Hybrids]
* a Camel looks really funny when its running, like most of the team :)
* a Camel is a horse designed by committee :)
* a [Camel in Action|http://www.groapacuprosti.com/2010/09/camel-in-action.html] is really funny

We generated some really cheesy tag lines like:

* You can go a long way with Camel!
* Don't get the hump get Camel!
* No where to evolve to ? Get Camel!
* One hump or two?
* Don't get lost in a desert of XML config files, get Camel!
* Its not a mirage, its a Camel!
