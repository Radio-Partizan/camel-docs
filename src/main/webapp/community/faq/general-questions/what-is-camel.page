Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework based on known [Enterprise Integration Patterns] with powerful [Bean Integration].

Camel lets you create the [Enterprise Integration Patterns] to implement routing and mediation rules in either a Java based [Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API)|DSL], via [Spring] based [Xml Configuration] files or via the [Scala DSL]. This means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether in your Java, Scala or XML editor.

Apache Camel uses [URIs] so that it can easily work directly with any kind of [Transport] or messaging model such as [HTTP], [ActiveMQ], [JMS], [JBI], SCA, [MINA] or [CXF Bus API|CXF] together with working with pluggable [Data Format] options. Apache Camel is a small library which has minimal [dependencies|What are the dependencies] for easy embedding in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same [API|Exchange] regardless which kind of [Transport] used, so learn the API once and you will be able to interact with all the [Components] that is provided out-of-the-box.

Apache Camel has powerful [Bean Binding] and integrated seamless with popular frameworks such as [Spring] and [Guice].

Apache Camel has extensive [Testing] support allowing you to easily unit test your routes. 

Apache Camel can be used as a routing and mediation engine for the following projects:

* [Apache ServiceMix|http://servicemix.apache.org/] which is the most popular and powerful distributed open source ESB and JBI container  
* [Apache ActiveMQ|http://activemq.apache.org/]  which is the most popular and powerful open source message broker
* [Apache CXF|http://cxf.apache.org/] which is a smart web services suite (JAX-WS) 
* [Apache MINA|http://mina.apache.org/] a networking framework

So don't get the hump, try Camel today! :)
