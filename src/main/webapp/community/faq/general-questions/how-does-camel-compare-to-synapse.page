h2. How does Camel compare to Synapse?

We are Camel developers so take what you read here with a pinch of salt. If you want to read a less biased comparison [try reading this review which has a slight Synapse bias since the author mostly uses Synapse :)|http://rajith.2rlabs.com/2008/02/11/synapse-vs-camel/]

However we think the main differences are:

* the Camel community is way more active according to the [nabble statistics|http://www.nabble.com/Camel-f22882.html] (Synapse is inside the Apache Web Services bar) or by comparing [Camel|http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=camel] and [Synapse|http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=synapse] on markmail.
* Camel is the default routing engine included in [Apache ActiveMQ|http://activemq.apache.org/] for Message Orientated middleware with EIP and [Apache ServiceMix|http://servicemix.apache.org/] the ESB based around OSGi and JBI at Apache - both of which are [very popular too|http://www.nabble.com/Apache-f90.html]
* Camel is designed from the ground up around [Enterprise Integration Patterns] - having a EIP pattern language implemented in [Java|DSL], [Spring XML|Spring], [Scala|Scala DSL] and [Groovy] as well as [EIP Visualisations|Visualisation] 
* Camel is designed to work with pretty much all kinds of [transport|Components] as well as working with any [Data Format]. When we first looked at Synapse it was based around Axis 2 and WS-* though apparently thats no longer the case.
