h2. How does the Camel API compare to from CXF, HTTP, JBI, JMS, JavaMail etc

We have tried to make the Camel [Exchange|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Exchange.html] and [Message|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Message.html] map very closely to [JBI] in particular but also [CXF], [HTTP], [JMS], [Mail], [XMPP] and most other integration abstractions. We want to prevent leaky abstractions, so the Camel API exposes the underlying APIs so that a [Processor] can make use of the underlying abstractions if they make sense.

For example

|| Component|| Inbound exchange exposes ||
| [CXF] | Each Inbound [CxfExchange|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-cxf/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/cxf/CxfExchange.html] has access to the underlying Exchange and Message from CXF |
| [HTTP] | Each inbound [HttpExchange|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-http/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/http/HttpExchange.html] has access to the underlying HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse |
| [JBI] | Each inbound [JbiExchange|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-jbi/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/jbi/JbiExchange.html] has access to the underlying JBI MessageExchange and NormalizedMessage objects |
| [JMS] | Each inbound [JmsExchange|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-jms/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/jms/JmsExchange.html] has access to the underlying JMS Message objects |

You can probably see a pattern forming now :).

For many routing and mediation components and [Processor] objects, you maybe don't care about the underlying transport and can instead stick to the abstract Camel API. But if you need to, the real transport APIs are there for you.
