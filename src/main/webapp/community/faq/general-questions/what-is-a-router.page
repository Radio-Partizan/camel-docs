h2. What is a router?

We often talk about that Camel is a mediation and routing framework; so what exactly is a router and what does it do?

Basically a router just consumes [Message] exchanges from some [Endpoint], then sends them on to some other [Endpoint] using some kind of [Enterprise Integration Patterns]. 

For example a router could implement the [Content Based Router] pattern, to route from an endpoint to one or more destination endpoints using a [Predicate] based on the message content.

Typically a route or router consists of one or more consumers; either an [Event Driven Consumer] or a [Polling Consumer] or possibly a [Transactional Client]. Then there are one or more [Processor] instances which could send the message to one or more endpoints.
