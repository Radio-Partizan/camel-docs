h2. How do I edit the website?

The website is all contained on a Wiki so that you can [contribute|Contributing] providing you are happy to license all your contributions under the [Apache Software License version 2.0|http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0]

h3. You must have signed an ICLA to be able to edit the wiki pages
* Download and print the Apache Contributor License Agreement from [here|http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html]. You need to sign it and fax it to Apache. In the past I've found its often faster to also post it via snail mail 
* wait for your name to appear on the [list of received CLAs|http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html] see the _unlisted CLAs_ section.
* send an email to the [Camel dev forum|Mailing Lists] about that your ICLA have been received at Apache.

h3. How to edit

To edit a page, just hit the *edit* link right at the bottom of any page. To be able to edit you need to register with confluence. 

{info:title=Spam Prevention}
We have been attacked by spammers so we are running a spam-avoiding scheme. So you have to ask to be added to the editing group of Confluence. This is quick and easy to do.

First click edit on a page to get to the confluence site of http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Index then register.

Then send an mail to the [developer forum|http://www.nabble.com/Camel-Development-f36429.html] giving details of your confluence and/or JIRA username and we can grant you the necessary editing karma.
{info}

Note that after you've changed the wiki it is immediately rendered on the http://cwiki.apache.org/CAMEL/ site so you can test it out; then up to an hour or two later it is updated on the Apache site.

h3. How the site works
There are a few special pages; for example the [Navigation] page is the left hand navigation bar and the [QuickLinks] is the top right navigation bar.
