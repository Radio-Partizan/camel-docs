h2. How does Camel work with ActiveMQ?

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the [Enterprise Integration Patterns] inside
* the ActiveMQ message broker
* the ActiveMQ JMS client

So Camel can route messages to and from [Mail], [File], [FTP], [JPA], [XMPP] other [JMS] providers and any of the other Camel [Components] as well as implementating all of the [Enterprise Integration Patterns] such as [Content Based Router] or [Message Translator].
