h2. How do the direct, event, seda and vm endpoints compare?

* [VM] and [SEDA] endpoints are basically the same; they both offer asychronous in memory SEDA queues; they differ in visibility endpoints are visible inside the same JVM or within the same CamelContext respectively.
* [Direct] uses no threading; it directly invokes the consumer when sending.
* [Event] adds a listener to Spring's application events; so the consumer is invoked the same thread as Spring notifies events. Event differs in that the payload should be a Spring ApplicationEvent object whereas [Direct], [SEDA] and [VM] can use any payload
