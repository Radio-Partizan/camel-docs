h2. How do I invoke Camel routes from JBI

When you use the [JBI] endpoint as follows

{code}
from("jbi:endpoint:http://foo.bar.org/MyService/MyEndpoint")
{code}

you automatically expose the endpoint to the NMR bus where service qname is 

{code}
{http://foo.bar.org}MyService
{code} 

and endpoint name is MyEndpoint.

Then if you send a message via the JBI NMR to this JBI endpoint then it will be sent to the above Camel route.

Sending works in the same way: you use 

{code}
to("jbi:endpoint:http://foo.bar.org/MyService/MyEndpoint") 

{code}

to send messages to JBI endpoint deployed to the bus. 

I noticed that people are used to somehow 'declaring' endpoints in SMX. In camel it is enough to simply start a flow from a jbi endpoint and camel will create it automatically.
