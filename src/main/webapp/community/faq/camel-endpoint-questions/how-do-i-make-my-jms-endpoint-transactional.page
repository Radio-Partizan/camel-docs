h2. How do I make my JMS endpoint transactional

I have a JMS route such as this...

{code}
from("activemq:Some.Queue").
  bean(MyProcessor.class);
{code}

how do I make it transactional?

h3. Answer

There are examples in the [Transactional Client] and it is described in the _Enabling Transacted Consumption_ section of [JMS]. Basically you enable the *transacted* flag on the JMS endpoint and set a transactionManager on the [Component] or [Endpoint]
