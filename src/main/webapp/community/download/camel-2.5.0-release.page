h2. New and Noteworthy

Welcome to the 2.5.0 release which approx 300 issues resolved (new features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Added {{suspend/resume}} operations to [CamelContext] for _warm_ restarts, or as the preferred way to temporary stop a running Camel application, and then later resume it. Those operations is also available in [JMX|Camel JMX].
* Improved management of routes in [JMX|Camel JMX]. You can now suspend/resume routes which support suspension. There is a new {{removeRoute}} to remove a route from [JMX|Camel JMX]. Routes with {{autoStartup=false}} is now also listed in [JMX|Camel JMX], to allow you to start the routes manually.
* The [Asynchronous Routing Engine] allows to be forced into synchronous mode for certain components, by specifying {{synchronous=true}} in the endpoint uri.
* [FTP|FTP2] now supports MSV file systems. The ftp consumer will now traverse the directory structure using a {{cd <dir>, list files in cur dir}} pattern, as opposed to a {{list files <dir>}} style.
* [FTP|FTP2] improved support for consuming using absolute paths.
* Fixed issue with using multiple [HTTP] endpoints with the only difference being {{httpClient}} parameters.
* Fixed issue with [Stream Caching] and deleting temporary files on Windows.
* Server thread pool settings can be configured on [Jetty] component.
* Easier to configure general HTTP/SSL socket connector properties on [Jetty] component.
* Fixed issue with sending an {{InOut}} message to [Dead Letter Channel] would cause Camel to expect a reply. Now the message will always be send to the DLQ as {{InOnly}}.
* Fixed issue when sending to a [JMS] destination, the option {{disableReplyTo}} was not used.
* Added two new functions to [XPath] to leverage [Properties] component and [Simple] language.
* Fixed issue when running [Jetty] server under heavy load throwing {{IllegalStateException}}
* [JMS] uses [Asynchronous Routing Engine] for [Request Reply] messaging over JMS.
* Fixed issue with a route could mistakenly pick up a route scoped [OnException|Exception Clause] from another route.
* Fixed an issue with starting {{CamelContext}} after it had been shutdown, leading to routes not properly being re-initialized and started.
* The [File|File2] and [FTP|FTP2] consumers now support using {{preMove}} together with either {{noop}} or {{delete}} options.
* Added support for {{timeout}} in [Recipient List], [Splitter] and [Multicast] EIPs when running in parallel mode.
* Added support for 3rd part [UuidGenerator].
* Reverted back to use ActiveMQ [UuidGenerator] as default generator. Its faster than the previous {{JavaUuidGenerator}}, especially in high concurrent systems. 
* [Velocity] can now find template files from filesystem/classpath when referring to them from other templates.
* Fixed issue with multiple [CamelContext] using same id being mixed as single [CamelContext] in [JMX|Camel JMX]. Camel now fails to start if existing [CamelContext] already have been registered in the MBeanServer.
* The [Message Filter] EIP now stores a property on the [Exchange] to indicate if it was filtered or not.
* [FTP|FTP2] supports sending site commands after successful login.
* [Simple] language can now compare numeric values which was entered as String types.
* Fixed limitation where [PollEnrich|Content Enricher] could not poll from a file endpoint if the route started from a file endpoint as well.
* Fixed limitation with [Simple] language, before you could only use one {{and}} or {{or}} operator. Now you can use multiple operators in the same expression.
* [Restlet] component now supports using \{ \} placeholders in uri, which gets replaced with headers from [Exchange].
* Added {{dynamicRouter}} to the DSL to make it easier to do dynamic routing using a [Bean] to evaluate _on-the-fly_ the next destination(s).
* When sending a [JMS] message using InOnly but having a {{JMSReplyTo}} header configured, then the {{JmsProducer}} will lookup/create the JMS Destination to ensure its a valid {{JMSReplyTo}} from the header.
* Endpoint uris containing password is not logged in plaintext, but is now masked.
* [Properties] can now leverage [Jasypt] allowing you to use encrypted values in your properties files.
* Trimmed down the size of the [Web Console] reducing the number of jars and removing the groovy experimental editor. It now requires JDK 1.6 to run as well. We will in the future improve the [Web Console] to contain more features and information.
* Added new [Language] component to execute [Languages] scripts when sending a message to a {{language}} endpoint. This makes it easier to support [Dynamic Router] where small pieces of logic must be executed as well.
* Added {{charset}} option on the [File|File2], [FTP|FTP2] endpoint which dictates the encoding to use.
* [CXF|CXF] consumer and [CXFRS|cxfrs] consumer will try to leverage CXF continuation API to call the camel process asynchronous API if it is possible, and you can turn it off by setting the {{synchronous}} option to {{true}}.
* [CXF Bean Component] now supports using customer providers configured by the {{providers}} option on the [CXFRS] endpoint.
* Fixed {{ConsumerTemplate}} using {{receiveBody}} methods to complete [OnCompletion] beforehand. For example when using a [File|File2] endpoint and having set {{delete=true}}, which now causes the file to be deleted.
* Fixed [HawtDB] not working in OSGi
* Fixed dependency injection between {{<bean>}} and {{<camelContext>}}, making it work as it did with Spring 2.5 when using Spring 3.0 instead. The {{<bean>}} will be dependency injected before the {{<camelContext>}}.
* Optimized [Type Converter] when using [Jetty] routing and/or conversions to {{String}} types which will fallback and lookup {{PropertyEditor}} editors.
* Added {{LimitedPollingConsumerPollStrategy}} for [Polling Consumer]s as a limited strategy which suspends consumers which causes consecutive failures. For example to avoid a faulty consumer to spam logs etc. Uses a limit of 3.
* Fixed [Jetty] sending back HTTP headers using keys is lower-case. Not it preserves the case of the keys, so it can be mixed case.
* Added $simple{ } as alternative syntax for tokens in the [Simple] language to avoid clashing when using Springs {{PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer}}. See example at the [File|File2] language page.
* Added {{discardOnCompletionTimeout}} option to [Aggregator|Aggregator2]
* Fixed concurrency issue when using predicates using binary operators such as {{isEqualTo}}.
* Total overhaul of the [QuickFix] component. Thanks to the [QuickFIX/J|http://www.quickfixj.org/] community for help.
* [CXFRS] producer now leverages fallback type converter which means its much easier for end users to grab the response body in a type they want.
* [Mail] component now supports specifying emails using {{"Ibsen, Claus" <davsclaus@apache.org>}} style.
* Fixed issue with [FTP|FTP2] which could cause the polling to stop without any hint in the logs why.
* Added {{publishedEndpointUrl}} option into the [CXF|CXF] component.
* {{DefaultPackageScanClassResolver}} supports to configure the url schemes by using Spring configuration. To cater for Server's using custom classloader schemes in URLs.
* Added option {{lazyLoadTypeConverters}} to [CamelContext] to configure if type converters should be loaded lazy or on startup (default).

h2. API breaking

* Some methods on the [File|File2] and [FTP|FTP2] endpoint/producer has been promoted from {{protected}} to {{public}} to make it easy from Java code to re-use the functionally of those methods, without using it as a Camel component. Such as when you want to communicate with a FTP server using the API from the {{RemoteFileOperations}}.
* Added {{changeToParentDirectory}} method to {{GenericFileOperations}}.

h2. Known Issues

* The [Tracer] may not output all details for some situations such as when using {{onCompletion}} or {{intercept}} etc.
* Not all [Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run the example using ANT.
* Project cannot be fully build using Maven 3.0
* One may encounter build errors in camel-ftp with java versions older than "1.5.0_24"
* Dozer does not work in OSGi
* {{camel-blueprint}} is not fully feature complete (such as @Producer, @Consume is not supported)
* {{camel-blueprint}} using <package> scan does not work
* Setting a custom TaskExecutor on [JMS] component using Spring 2.5 does not work as {{camel-jms}} is compiled against Spring 3.0. See more at [CAMEL-3286|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3286]

h2. Important changes to consider when upgrading

* Support for [JMS] API 1.0.2 has been removed.
* The {{stopRoute}} method on {{CamelContext}} now leverages [Graceful shutdown] when stopping. This is more intuitive to stop routes in a graceful and safe manner. You can the stop method with a timeout if you want to force stopping, which was the old behavior.
* The [Web Console] now requires JDK 1.6 as minimum to run.
* The artifacts {{camel-core-tests.jar}} and {{camel-spring-tests.jar}} has been *deprecated* and will be removed in a future release. You should always only use the {{camel-test.jar}} if you want to use the Camel Test Kit.
* Camel will now fail to startup if an existing CamelContext has been registered in JMX with the same id.
* If you did not set a id on {{<camelContext>}} it would have defaulted to {{camelContext}}. This has been changed to be the auto assigned name it's given by Camel, such as {{camel-1}}, {{camel-2}} etc.
* Maven version 2.2.1 or better is now required to build Camel from source.
* If using [Quartz] with jobs persisted in a database, then mind that Camel now resolves job names based on endpoint uri, _without_ parameters. This allows you to change cron parameters on the same job (reschedule jobs).
* The {{timeout}} option on [Netty] has been removed as it was flawed.
* Durable topic subscribers with [JMS] must now provide {{clientId}}, otherwise Camel will fail fast on startup.
* The default [UUidGenerator] has been changed back to be ActiveMQ based. If you run in the cloud you may have to configure to use the old default {{JavaUuidGenerator}} as the ActiveMQ may use JDK API which is not accessible in the cloud.
* If you use the [FTP|FTP2] component (consumers) make sure to test it throughly as it has changed how it traverse the file structure.
* Upgraded to Spring 3.0.4
* Upgraded to CXF 2.2.11
