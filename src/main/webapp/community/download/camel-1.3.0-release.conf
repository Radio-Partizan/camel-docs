h2. Known Issues

Please be aware of the cacheLevelName setting when using the [JMS] and [ActiveMQ] components; the defaults have changed recently to work around some bugs in Spring that are fixed in version 2.5.x. Please refer to the warnings on the [JMS page|JMS] for more details.

There is an issue in [Error Handler] if you have configured 2 or more exception clauses. Camel picks the first clause that is an instance of the thrown exception. Chances are that if you have configued a top level clause such as java.lang.Exception that Camel could pick this clause over a more specialized clause such as java.io.Exception for network related issues. The issue is reported in CAMEL-410.
