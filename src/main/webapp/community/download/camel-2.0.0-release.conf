h2. New and Noteworthy

Welcome to the 2.0.0 release which approx 760 issues resolved (new features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)
* Introduced [type converter registry|Type Converter] to allow end users to programmatic get access to this registry
* major improvements to [Jetty] for better handling of exception/faults and easier end-user customization how response should be written
* major improvements to [File] for consuming files, now supporting pluggable sorting, filtering and idempotent repositories.
* major refactor and improvements to [FTP], aligning it with the [File] component.
* minor improvements to [JDBC], [SQL], [Http] and [Mina]
* major refactor and improvements to [CXF] component.&nbsp; CxfBinding, HeaderFilterStrategy, Bus can be looked up from registry and configured at the endpoint level.
* [File] and [FTP] producers added option to write files using a temporary name and then rename it to the real name after the write completes
* [SFTP|FTP] added support for knownhosts and privatekey files
* [Mail] now supports setting additional SUN java mail properties
* [Mina] now supports setting text line delimiters for textline codec.
* [Mina] producer now throws CamelExchangeException in case no response received from remote server when in sync mode (sync=true)
* RedeliveryPolicy added support for ref attribute to reference a existing policy in the [Registry]
* [RedeliveryPolicy|Dead Letter Channel] added {{delayPattern}} option for using a special pattern for setting different delay based on intervals 
* Added {{onWhen}} and {{retryUntil}} predicates to [Exception Clause]
* [List] component renamed to [Browse]
* [Exception Clause] is much smarter as it will use caused by exception hierarchy for matching as well (will use bottom ups)
* [Dead Letter Channel] and [Exception Clause] now have {{onRedeliver}} to allow custom processing an [Exchange] *before* its being redelivered. Allowing you to work on the message being sent.
* Added support for [\# syntax in Endpoint URI's|How do I configure endpoints] to allow endpoint URI's to refer to bean in the [Registry].
* {{consumer.}} prefix can be omitted for scheduled polling consumers such as [File], [FTP] consumers. Thus the URI options is more simpler and you don't have to remember which requires {{consumer.}} prefix and which doesn't.
* [Tracer] improved to allow custom routing and processing of TraceEventMessage so you can store trace logs as you like, for instance in a database.
* [Tracer] now also displays the previous node so you can see where the Exchange is coming from.
* [Quartz] has added support for stateful jobs.
* Introduced @FallbackConverter for using annotation based fallback type converters
* Extended [content enrichment|Content Enricher] support via the [enrich|Content Enricher#enrich-dsl] DSL element.
* [Simple] language now supports a basic set of operators.
* [Aggregator] now supports grouped exchanges out of the box, so you can combine all aggregated exchanges into a single grouped exchange going out.
* Multiple inputs can be define as input to routes: {{from("activemq:queue:order", "file://order").to("bean:handleOrder");}}
* CXF component supports a new "cxfbean" endpoint that allows RESTful requests to be routed to JAXRS annotated service beans.
* Setting cron expression in camel-quartz improved.
* Better handling of interrupts while shutting down.
* The JMSReplyTo destination is available as Exchange property when consuming JMS messages.
* Better support for {{InOptionalOut}} Message Exchange Pattern. 
* [Pluggable Class Resolvers] SPI for class resolvers allowing third party platforms such as JBoss to provide integration with Camel.
* Refined API to reduce package tangling.
* Introduced wireTap node for the [Wire Tap] EIP pattern, supporting the traditional tapping and sending a new message.
* Added {{fromF}} and {{toF}} in the Java DSL to build uri strings using String.format with arguments, e.g.: {{fromF("ftp://%s@myserver?password=%s", user, password)..to}}
* Improved tooling being able to retrieve more runtime information from the {{CamelContext}}
* Scala DSL is improved
* Added {{JmsMessageType}} option to [JMS] to allow you to set which {{javax.jms.Message}} implementation to use for sending a JMS message.
* Fixed a rare bug when JMX is disabled, a [Dead Letter Channel] could mistakenly be added to some routes, when a global {{noErrorHandler}} was configured.
* [JMS] is now able to preserve hyphen in JMS keys (eg Content-Type can be sent as a Message header). Introduced pluggable strategy to allow end users to use their custom key formatter for encode/decode.
* Added option {{transferExchange}} to [JMS] so you can transfer the [Exchange] over the wire. Can be used to use JMS queues for [Dead Letter Channel] to preserve all information from the failed [Exchange] including the original exception with stack trace. 
* Added option {{transferException}} to [JMS] so when using [Request Reply] messaging with JMS, any caused exception on the server side will be returned as response to the client.  
* Added {{rollback}} as DSL keyword to force a rollback of the given [Exchange]. Does this by throwing an {{org.apache.camel.RollbackExchangeException}}.
* Added SOAP Message Header filtering capability in camel-cxf component.
* ProducerTeamplate API reworked for sendBody operations to return void, as they are InOnly. Use requestBody if you need InOut.
* Introduced {{ConsumerTemplate}} supporting the [Polling Consumer] EIP
* Custom endpoints with Spring @ManagedResource is now also registered in the mbean server.
* The default error handler is changed from [Dead Letter Channel] to [DefaultErrorHandler].
* [HTTP] component added option {{throwException}} that can be disabled to allow failed response codes to be returned without throwing a HttpOperationsFailedException.
* Overhaul and improvements to the [Try Catch Finally] DSLs, so they are on pair with the [Exception Clause].
* Overhaul and improvements to the [Intercept] DSLs. Added new {{interceptSendToEndpoint}} to intercept sending to a given [Endpoint].
* Added the notion of a Channel in the routes.
* Added support to navigate the routes at runtime, so you can dynamic change or affect the processors in the routes.
* Introduced a new [Async] API for asynchronous messaging.
* [Jetty] now supports configuring Handler for e.g. security.
* [Jetty] connector can now be shared among multiple CamelContext
* [iBatis] added option to set {{StatementType}} for fine grained control of which SqlMapClient operation to invoke. Allowing [iBatis] component to be used like [Sql] or the [Jdbc] component. 
* Added [OnCompletion] callback to [Exchange] so you can do custom routing when an [Exchange] is completed. You can for instance use it to send an email if an [Exchange] failed.
* Added [Failover|Load Balancer] as load balancer.
* Added {{throwException}} to the DSL.
* Added [@Handler|Bean Binding] annotation to mark a method to be invoked when using [POJO|Bean Integration] in routes.
* [Predicate] uses type coercion for improving matching, thus allowing you for instance to compare a String with an Integer, "true" with a boolean, or enum type as string etc. 
* Started to standardize consumers that supported batching as a [Batch Consumer].
* [Connection pooling|ServicePool] for [FTP|FTP2] and [Mina] producers. This allows thread safe concurrency usage of these components out of the box. The connection pooling is pluggable so you can use a 3rd party pool framework. 
* Added option {{fileExist}} to [File|File2] and [FTP|FTP2] component. This option allows you to configure what should happen when you write a file and an existing file with that name already exists. The [File|File2] producer will now by default *Override* existing files. In Camel 1.x it would default append. 
* [Seda] and [Vm] now supports [Request Reply] and waiting for the reply if one expected.
* Fixed issue with using 3rd party annotations and Camel annotations in same POJO class. Now all annotations is processed by Spring.
* Added [Jackson|http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jackson] as supported library for the [JSon] data format.
* Simplified using [Delayer] especially in Spring DSL.
* Improved [Idempotent Consumer] to eagerly detect duplicated messages for in progress exchanges.
* Added [Camel property to set a max chars limit|How do I set the max chars when debug logging messages in Camel] for {{DEBUG}} logs Message bodies. To avoid logging very big payloads. The default limit is 1000 chars.
* Configuration of http proxy is now possible with the [HTTP] component
* [Message Filter] EIP marks Exchanges as filtered and is now skipped for aggregation in {{AggregationStrategy}} for example used when doing [Splitter] or [Aggregator]
* [DefaultErrorHandler] is now just as powerful as [Dead Letter Channel] support redelivery et. all.
* [Dead Letter Channel] will by default *handle* exceptions.
* [TransactionErrorHandler] is now just as powerful as [Dead Letter Channel] support redelivery et. all.
* Introduced [{{<packageScan>}}|Spring] tag in camel-spring to replace {{<packages>}} and it support ANT path style filtering of classes to include/exclude. 
* [Stream caching] is now default disabled. Improved how to configure it as enabled/disabled.
* Various Camel annotations such as {{@Consume}} have new option {{context}} to specify a particular [CamelContext] it should apply for. Needed when you have multiple [CamelContext].
* Major improvements to [Tracer] as its now much more fine grained and capable of tracing sub routes and all the advanced stuff such as [Intercept], [Exception Clause] and [OnCompletion].
* Introduced [PollingConsumerPollStrategy|Polling Consumer] as a pluggable strategy for scheduled consumers, allowing you to control what should happen if an exception occurred during the initial phase of {{poll}}, such as a file consumer not being able to connect to a network drive. 
* Added {{pollEnrich}} to DSL supporting using a [Polling Consumer] with the [Content Enricher] EIP pattern. This allows you for instance to poll a file (or FTP file) during routing directly in the DSL.
* Improved endpoint resolution to better detect similar endpoints and be more tolerant for minor user input mistakes.
* [FTP|FTP2] now supports trying to reconnect a number of times in case a connection to the remote FTP server could not be established. There are options to control this behavior. |
* When running in OSGi Camel will also lookup in OSGi registry when doing [Registry] lookup. Will first lookup in OSGi, and then the default [Registry].
* Added [AOP] to do custom processing before routing using AOP concepts such as: around, before, after etc. 
* [Tracer], [Delayer|Delay Interceptor], [Stream Caching] and handle fault now has higher granularity as you can configure it on both camel context and per route level. Where per route will override camel context level.
* [Exchange] api cleanup. Complete removal of specialized Exchange using generics.
* Merged out and fault semantics.
* [Async] API improved with client API that uses callbacks that are invoked when the exchange is done allowing you to gather the response in callbacks.
* Headers in {{org.apache.camel.Message}} is now case insensitive meaning that you can lookup headers using different cased keys such as {{Foo}} and {{foo}} will return the same value. This reduces mistakes when headers from [Http] protocols is used as they can contain different cases.
* Performance improvements
* Fixes for [Camel Maven Archetypes]
* Added SSL support to Camel [IRC]
* Many fixes in the [CXF], [FTP], [Log], [Mail], [JMS] and others
* Major improvements and fixes in [Bindy]
* Removed platforms specific encoding from kits
* Fixed issues related to class loading in OSGi
* [Bean] also supports lookup in OSGi registry
* Introduced [<pacakgeScan>|Spring] in Spring XML that supports ANT path style filtering
* Introduced {{PollingConsumerPollStrategy}} as pluggable strategy for fine grained error handling with [Polling Consumer]
* [Stream caching] is disabled by default
* Camel using Spring DSL will automatic register a Producer and/or ConsumerTemplate if not defined already using ids {{template}}, {{consumerTemplate}}. Convention over configuration.

h2. API breaking

h3. Core API

h4. Specialized Exchange
All specializations of {{org.apache.camel.Exchange}} are now removed. You should use {{org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExchange}}. Although it looked like a good idea initially we recognized that the specialized Exchanges were not really necessary and by removing them we can avoid a lot of unnecessary copying and improve throughput.

h4. Fault and Out Consolidation
The get/set Fault apis on the Exchange are now removed. Faults represent application specific errors and are recognized by some protocols. As a result Camel treats faults as out in an exchange.  The {{org.apache.camel.Message}} interface has not a get/setFault(boolean) api to identify out messages that represent in fact a fault.
Since Faults represent persistent errors (as opposed to exceptions that represent transient errors) Camel does not try (as in previous versions) to recover from them (i.e. the error handler does not trigger) unless handling faults as exceptions is explicitly enabled.

h4. Exchange copy() api
We also consolidated redundant copy related apis in {{org.apache.camel.Exchange}} as they were pretty much doing the same thing. The following two apis were removed {{newInstance()}}, {{copyFrom(Exchange)}}. {{copy(boolean)}} found a better home at {{org.apache.camel.util.ExchangeHelper}}.

h3. Client API

h4. Routes
The {{org.apache.camel.Routes}} interface have been renamed to {{org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder}} and having a more precise and simpler interface.
This only affects advanced users that implement their own route builder integration with Camel from a foreign languages such as Ruby etc.

h4. StreamCache
[Stream caching] is now default disabled. If you use streams and want Camel to cache the stream in case you for instance use Camel to do redeliveries then you must enable stream cache so the stream can be re-read on delivery. 

h4. AggregationStrategy
The payload is now *always* only stored in {{IN}} when you do custom aggregation using this strategy interface.
Before the payload could also be in {{OUT}} and it could be confusing where to get the real payload you should use.

h4. ProducerTemplate
The sendBody methods now return void for InOnly messaging. Use requestBody if you want InOut messaging.

h4. AggregationStrategy
The aggregate method is now also invoked on the very first exchange. Allowing the end users to be in full power.
At this first invocation the {{oldExchange}} parameter is {{null}}.

h3. Notable changes to DSL
* Renamed DSL operations
** splitter \-> split
** resequencer \-> resequence
** aggregator \-> aggregate
** delayer \-> delay
** throttler \-> throttle
** expression \-> language
** try (Spring DSL) \-> doTry
** catch (Spring DSL) \-> doCatch
** finally (Spring DSL) \-> doFinally
** tryBlock (Java DSL) \-> doTry
** handle (Java DSL) \-> doCatch
** finallyBlock (Java DSL) \-> doFinally
** intercept \-> interceptFrom
** thread \-> threads
** throwFault has been removed, you can set a the fault using the {{exchange.setFault}} method

* Renamed DSL in SpringBuilder
** bean \-> lookup  

h3. Components
- The [List] component is renamed to [Browse] component
- The [Queue] component has been removed
- The [FTP] component have renamed some of its URI options
- The [File] component have renamed some of its URI options
- The [CXF] component have been refactored and APIs have been simplified

h2. Known Issues
See known issues from previous releases.

If you have multiple [Mail] endpoints and defined recipients on these endpoints, Camel could mixup and only use the recipients defined on the last endpoint. See more at CAMEL-2232.

h2. Important changes to consider when upgrading

If you specialized existing components and used specialized {{org.apache.camel.Exchange}} classes, your code will need updating to use {{org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExchange}} instead.

The default error handler is no longer [Dead Letter Channel] but [DefaultErrorHandler] that by default do not try to redeliver.
