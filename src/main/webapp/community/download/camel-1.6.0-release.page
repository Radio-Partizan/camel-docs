Welcome to the 1.6.0 release which approx 169 issues resolved (new features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* [HTTP] supports authentication
* [Mina] producer now throws CamelExchangeException in case no response received from remote server when in sync mode (sync=true)
* [SFTP|FTP] added support for knownhosts, privatekey files and passive mode
* Added {{onWhen}} predicate to [Exception Clause]
* [Exception Clause] is much smarter as it will use caused by exception hierarchy for matching as well (will use bottom ups)

h2. Important changes to consider when upgrading

h3. JAXB data format
If you use XJC to create the java class from the schema, you will get a ObjectFactory for you JAXB context. Since the ObjectFactory uses JAXBElement to hold the reference of the schema and element instance value, from Camel 1.6.0 jaxbDataformat will ignore the JAXBElement by default and you will get the element instance value instead of the JAXBElement object form the unmarshaled message body.
If you want to get the JAXBElement object form the unmarshaled message body, you need to set the JaxbDataFormat object's ignoreJAXBElement property to be false.
