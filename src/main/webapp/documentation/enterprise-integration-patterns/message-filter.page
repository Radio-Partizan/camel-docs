h3. Message Filter

The [Message Filter|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Filter.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] allows you to filter messages

!http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/img/MessageFilter.gif!

The following example shows how to create a Message Filter route consuming messages from an endpoint called *queue:a* which if the [Predicate] is true will be dispatched to *queue:b*

*Using the [Fluent Builders]*
{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/builder/RouteBuilderTest.java}

You can of course use many different [Predicate] languages such as [XPath], [XQuery], [SQL] or various [Scripting Languages]. Here is an [XPath  example|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/XPathFilterTest.java] 

{snippet:id=example|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/XPathFilterTest.java}

*Using the [Spring XML Extensions]*
{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/xml/buildSimpleRouteWithHeaderPredicate.xml}

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at the [junit test case|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/FilterTest.java?view=markup]

h4. Using stop
*Available as of Camel 2.0*

Stop is a bit different than a message filter as it will filter out all messages. Stop is convenient to use in a [Content Based Router] when you for example need to stop further processing in one of the predicates.

In the example below we do not want to route messages any further that has the word {{Bye}} in the message body. Notice how we prevent this in the when predicate by using the {{.stop()}}.
{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/RouteStopTest.java}


h4. Knowing if [Exchange] was filtered or not
*Available as of Camel 2.5*

The [Message Filter] EIP will add a property on the [Exchange] which states if it was filtered or not.

The property has the key {{Exchannge.FILTER_MATCHED}} which has the String value of {{CamelFilterMatched}}. Its value is a boolean indicating {{true}} or {{false}}. If the value is {{true}} then the [Exchange] was routed in the filter block.
