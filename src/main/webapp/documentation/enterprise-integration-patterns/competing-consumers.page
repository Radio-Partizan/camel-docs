h3. Competing Consumers

Camel supports the [Competing Consumers|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] using a few different components.

!http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/img/CompetingConsumers.gif!

You can use the following components to implement competing consumers:-

* [Seda] for SEDA based concurrent processing using a thread pool
* [JMS] for distributed SEDA based concurrent processing with queues which support reliable load balancing, failover and clustering.

h3. Enabling Competing Consumers with JMS

To enable Competing Consumers you just need to set the *concurrentConsumers* property on the [JMS] endpoint.

For example

{code}
from("jms:MyQueue?concurrentConsumers=5").bean(SomeBean.class);
{code}

Or just run multiple JVMs of any [ActiveMQ] or [JMS] route :)
