h3. Content Based Router

The [Content Based Router|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] allows you to route messages to the correct destination based on the contents of the message exchanges.

The following example shows how to route a request from an input *seda:a* endpoint to either *seda:b*, *seda:c* or *seda:d* depending on the evaluation of various [Predicate] expressions

*Using the [Fluent Builders]*
{snippet:id=e3|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/builder/RouteBuilderTest.java}

*Using the [Spring XML Extensions]*
{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/xml/buildSimpleRouteWithChoice.xml}

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at the [junit test case|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/ChoiceTest.java?view=markup]
