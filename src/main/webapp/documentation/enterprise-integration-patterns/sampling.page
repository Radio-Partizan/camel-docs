h2. Sampling Throttler
*Available as of Camel 2.1*

A sampling throttler allowing you to extract a sample of exchanges from the traffic through a route.
It is configured with a sampling period during which only a single exchange is allowed to pass through. All other exchanges will be stopped.

Will by default use a sample period of 1 seconds. 

h3. Samples
You use this EIP with the {{sample}} DSL as show in these samples.

*Using the [Fluent Builders]*
These samples also show how you can use the different syntax to configure the sampling period:
{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/SamplingThrottlerTest.java}

*Using the [Spring XML Extensions]*
And the same example in Spring XML is:
{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/samplingThrottler.xml}

And since it uses a default of 1 second you can omit this configuration in case you also want to use 1 second
{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/samplingThrottlerWithDefault.xml}
