h3. Publish Subscribe Channel

Camel supports the [Publish Subscribe Channel|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PublishSubscribeChannel.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] using the following components

* [JMS] for working with JMS Topics for high performance, clustering and load balancing
* [XMPP] when using rooms for group communication

h4. Using Routing Logic

Another option is to explicitly list the publish-subscribe relationship in your routing logic; this keeps the producer and consumer decoupled but lets you control the fine grained routing configuration using the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration].
