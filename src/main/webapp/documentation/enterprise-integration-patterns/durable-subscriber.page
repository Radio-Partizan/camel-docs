h3. Durable Subscriber

Camel supports the [Durable Subscriber|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DurableSubscription.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] using the [JMS] component which supports publish & subscribe using Topics with support for non-durable and durable subscribers.

Another alternative is to combine the [Message Dispatcher] or [Content Based Router] with [File] or [JPA] components for durable subscribers then something like [Queue] for non-durable.
