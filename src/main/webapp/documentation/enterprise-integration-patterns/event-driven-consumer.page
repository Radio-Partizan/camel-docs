h3. Event Driven Consumer

Camel supports the [Event Driven Consumer|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventDrivenConsumer.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns]. The default consumer model is event based (i.e. asynchronous) as this means that the Camel container can then manage pooling, threading and concurrency for you in a declarative manner.

The Event Driven Consumer is implemented by consumers implementing the [Processor|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html] interface which is invoked by the [Message Endpoint] when a [Message] is available for processing.
