h3. Correlation Identifier

Camel supports the [Correlation Identifier|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CorrelationIdentifier.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] by getting or setting a header on a [Message]. 

When working with the [ActiveMQ] or [JMS] components the correlation identifier header is called *JMSCorrelationID*. You can add your own correlation identifier to any message exchange to help correlate messages together to a single conversation (or business process).

The use of a Correlation Identifier is key to working with the [Camel Business Activity Monitoring Framework|BAM] and can also be highly useful when testing with simulation or canned data such as with the [Mock testing framework|Mock]
