h4. CI builds using Hudson
Continuous integration builds for Apache Camel have been set up at http://hudson.zones.apache.org.  More information about using Hudson at Apache can be found at http://wiki.apache.org/general/Hudson.
If you are a Camel PMC member and would like to have access to the Hudson administration, you can find instructions for getting your own user id on the same wiki page.

We have several views available for Apache Camel:
* http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Camel/ gives you a view on last status of every Camel build we have
* http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Camel/job/Camel/ shows a short history of recent builds for Camel trunk
* http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Camel/job/Camel-1.x/ shows the same kind of history for the Camel-1.x branch

h4. Code health reports

Sonar leverages well-known tools such as Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs, Cobertura, Clover and JavaNCSS to provide an integrated and easy to use quality management platform. The Sonar guys were kind enough to add Camel to their public server at Codehaus

h4. Problems? Suggestions?
Access to Hudson administration is currently being limited to PMC members by the Apache Infrastructure team, but several PMC members already have an account on these machines so you can just contact the [developer mailing list|Mailing Lists] for any problems or suggestions with the way the builds have been set up.
