h2. Camel 3.0 roadmap

This is a roadmap which details the overall and major goals for Camel 3.0. Fell free to discuss this at the Camel [Mailing Lists] if you have ideas or feedback.

h4. JDK 1.6+

Camel 3.0 should bump the JDK minimum version to 1.6.
Camel 1.x/2.x supports JDK 1.5+. 

h4. Spring 3.x

Camel 3.0 should bump the minimum version of Spring to 3.0+.
Camel 1.x/2.x supports Spring 2.0+

h4. Routing engine optimization

The internal routing engine should be optimized. See more details at [Camel 2.x Speed optimizations].

h4. Tighten up route definitions

Currently cross cutting concerns such as error handlers, interceptors, onCompletion etc. can be define anywhere in the route. We should tighten this up and only allow this to be configured in the start of the route. This also ensures when end users use code assistance in their route development, the IDE will not popup a big list which includes these cross cutting concerns. See also next note. (ProcessorDefinition will therefore be trimmed)

h4. More flexible routes at runtime

When routes is added in Camel 2.x architecture, global cross cutting concerns such as error handlers, interceptors, onCompletion etc. is applied when the route is added. We need to separate this and have those applied during routing. The {{Channel}} needs to do this and therefore it must be more dynamic than its currently is. And we need to enlist the various global cross cutting concerns by their xxxDefintions in the CamelContext, so we can access them at any time. This allows end users also much more easily to add/remove interceptors, error handlers and whatnot at runtime. And it makes it much easier to add routes generated from JAXB or other sources, as we don't need to prepare or anyhow _mold_ the {{RouteDefinition}} given. See ticket [CAMEL-3024|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3024] for some details. 

h4. Support for asynchronous transactions

When using the asynchronous routing engine it would be desirable of transactional context could be propagated to the new threads.
This requires the TX manager supports suspend/resume on the TX. G.Nodet have worked a bit on this. See [CAMEL-2902|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2902]. Also see [CAMEL-2729|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2729].

h4. Remove @deprecated

@deprecated features, methods, etc. is to be removed.

h4. Logging

We should switch from {{commons-logging}} to {{slf4j}}

h4. Stream caching

We could add support for using [HawtDB] as the persistent store for streams which overflow to disk store.

h4. EIP

The [Resequencer] EIP currently doesn't support persistence, we could introduce this and let it leverage [HawtDB] such as we did with the [Aggregator2] EIP.

h4. Schedule in DSL

We could consider adding DSL syntax sugar for scheduling routes. For example currently you have to use [Quartz] or a {{ScheduledPollingConsumer}} which has the {{delay}} option. We could add DSL which has something like:

{code}
schedule().every(5).minute().pollFrom("xxx").to("yyyy")
{code}

The hard part is to come up with a good DSL syntax. We can look at [BAM] and see what we got there as well.

The DSL should support both cron and non cron based, eg [Quartz], [Spring] (spring 3 has cron) and regular JDK timers.

h4. Fix routes with multiple inputs

The current implementation of routes with multiple inputs is to clone the route, which means you essentially got 2+ routes if a route has multiple inputs. However routes with multiple inputs is seldom used. The correct implementation is to only create one route but have multiple input consumers. This change will require a bit of change in current code as it relies on the _only 1 input consumer_ on the route.

h4. Up-to-date Scala DSL

The Scala DSL is slightly out of date as we have improved the DSL a bit here and there. We should check the gap and ensure the Scala is up-to-date.

h4. More EIPs as @annotations

Currently its only the [Routing Slip] and [Recipient List] which are avail as @annotation as well. We could add more [EIP]s as annotations such as [Splitter].
And also maybe annotations for {{AggregationStrategy}} to make this less Camel API dependent, so you can use a plain POJO for that.

h4. Asynchronous transactions

With the [Asynchronous Routing Engine] it would be great if we could support asynchronous transaction as well. See [CAMEL-2729|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2729] and [CAMEL-2902|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2902]

h4. Unified statistics

Currently the performance statistics is only avail when using JMX. We should allow those stats to be enabled regardless if JMX is enabled or not. Then we can use those stats from the web console. This also allows to expose those stats in the cloud where JMX is often not possible to be used.

h4. SEDA/VM components to leverage async routing engine

This allows to use non blocking request-reply over [SEDA] and [VM]. The reason why we havent converted in 2.4 is it causes a bigger API breakage.
