h2. Using the XSDs in configuration files

When you are using [Spring]'s 2.5 XML handling to parse the XML then you need to refer to the XSD locations in your XML document.

You can refer to a specific version of the XSD in your XML as follows

{code:xml}
<beans 
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="

    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd

    http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring 
      http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring-2.5.0.xsd">
{code}

or if you prefer you can use a generic XSD without the version number

{code:xml}
<beans 
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="

    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
 
    http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring
      http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">
{code}

Your IDE won't be able to fetch this XSD, you'll have to manually associate a specific release; however it does mean that you won't have to upgrade your XML config file with each Camel release; as it will resolve this XSD using the bundled XSD inside the camel-spring.jar.
