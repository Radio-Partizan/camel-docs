h2. Templating

When you are testing distributed systems its a very common requirement to have to stub out certain external systems with some stub so that you can test other parts of the system until a specific system is available or written etc.

A great way to do this is using some kind of Template system to generate responses to requests generating a dynamic message using a mostly-static body.

There are a number of templating components you could use

* [Freemarker]
* [Scalate]
* [StringTemplate]
* [Velocity]
* [XQuery]
* [XSLT]

h3. Example

Here's a simple example showing how we can respond to InOut requests on the *My.Queue* queue on [ActiveMQ] with a template generated response. The reply would be sent back to the JMSReplyTo Destination.

{code}
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm");
{code}

If you want to use InOnly and consume the message and send it to another destination you could use

{code}
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm").
  to("activemq:Another.Queue");
{code}

* [Mock] for details of mock endpoint testing (as opposed to template based stubs).
