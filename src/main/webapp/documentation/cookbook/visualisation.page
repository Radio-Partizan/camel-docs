h2. Visualisation

Camel supports the visualisation of your [Enterprise Integration Patterns] using the [GraphViz|http://graphviz.org] DOT files which can either be rendered directly via a suitable GraphViz tool or turned into HTML, PNG or SVG files via the [Camel Maven Plugin].

Here is a [typical example|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-spring/cameldoc/index.html] of the kind of thing we can generate

!org.apache.camel.example.docs.ContentBasedRouteRoute.png!

If you click on [the actual generated html|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/examples/camel-example-docs/cameldoc/main/routes.html]you will see that you can navigate from an EIP node to its pattern page, along with getting hover-over tool tips ec.

h3. How to generate
See [Camel Dot Maven Goal] or the other maven goals [Camel Maven Plugin]

h3. For OS X users

If you are using OS X then you can open the DOT file using [graphviz|http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/] which will then automatically re-render if it changes, so you end up with a real time graphical representation of the topic and queue hierarchies!

Also if you want to edit the layout a little before adding it to a wiki to distribute to your team, open the DOT file with [OmniGraffle|http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/] then just edit away :)
