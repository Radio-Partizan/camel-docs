h2. EventNotifier to log details about all sent Exchanges

If you want to log information all time taken to send and receive replies when sending to external endpoints, then you can leverage the {{EventNotifier}} in Camel. It allows you to subscribe to events and react upon them.

For example we want to log the time it takes to send to endpoints which can be done by implementing a class which this logic as follows:
{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|title=MyLoggingSentEventNotifier|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/MyLoggingSentEventNotifer.java}

Then in Java DSL you can tell Camel to use your custom {{EventNotifier}} simply by adding it:
{code}
context.getManagementStrategy().addEventNotifier(new MyLoggingSentEventNotifer());
{code} 

And in Spring XML you declare a Spring bean and Camel will automatic pick it up:
{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/EventNotifierExchangeSentExampleTest.xml}

If you run this example you will notice how Camel logs this now:
{code}
INFO  CamelContextFactoryBean        - Using custom EventNotifier with id: myLoggingEventNotifier and implementation: org.apache.camel.processor.MyLoggingSentEventNotifer@76bf9e
INFO  MyLoggingSentEventNotifer      - Took 1001 millis to send to: Endpoint[direct://bar]
INFO  MyLoggingSentEventNotifer      - Took 0 millis to send to: Endpoint[mock://result]
INFO  MyLoggingSentEventNotifer      - Took 1013 millis to send to: Endpoint[direct://start]
{code}

You can implement logic to filter which endpoints to log, and maybe also thresholds to skip logging if it was fast, e.g. < 1 sec.
Then you have a logger which logs all _slow_ events.

Tip you can use the {{EndpointHelper.matchEndpoint}} method to leverage the same filtering capabilities that for example the [Intercept] uses in Camel.

You can see which {{EventObject}} Camel provides from the [javadoc|http://camel.apache.org/maven/camel-2.2.0/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/management/event/package-summary.html].
