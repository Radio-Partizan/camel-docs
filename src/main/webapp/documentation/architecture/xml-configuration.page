h2. Xml Configuration

We recommend developers use the Java [Domain Specific Language|DSL] when writing routing rules as this provides maximum IDE completion and functionality while being the most expressive. However if you wish to put your routing rules in XML you can via the Camel XML language.

Camel XML uses [Spring] 2 namespaces; so that you can configure your routing rules within your [Spring XML configuration file|Spring]; you can also use [Java code to configure components and endpoints|How do I configure endpoints].

For examples on how to use Camel XML, see the [Enterprise Integration Patterns] or refer to the [Spring Support|Spring].
