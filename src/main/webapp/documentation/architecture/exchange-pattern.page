h2. Exchange Pattern

There are many different _Message Exchange Patterns_ you can use in messaging. This concept is also demonstrated in WSDL and JBI's MEPs.

From there [Enterprise Integration Patterns] the common examples are

* [Request Reply]
* [Event Message] (or one way)

In Camel we have an [ExchangePattern|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ExchangePattern.html] enumeration which can be configured on the *exchangePattern* property on the Message [Exchange] indicating if a message exchange is a one way [Event Message] (InOnly) or a [Request Reply] message exchange (InOut).

For example to override the default pattern on a [JMS] endpoint you could use this URI

{code}
jms:MyQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
{code}
