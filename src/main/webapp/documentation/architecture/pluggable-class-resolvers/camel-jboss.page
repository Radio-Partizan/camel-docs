h2. camel-jboss
*Available as of Camel 2.1*

The [camel-jboss] is a component which allows you to run Camel inside JBoss Application Server. This component is needed due JBoss classloading challenges.
The component is a specialized Camel [Pluggable Class Resolvers] to remedy this.

The resolver is provided in the class {{org.apache.camel.jboss.JBossPackageScanClassResolver}} in the {{camel-jboss}} jar file.

h3. Using with Java DSL

You need to configure the resolver on the [CamelContext] which is done like this:
{code:java}
  PackageScanClassResolver jbossResolver = new JBossPackageScanClassResolver();

  CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
  context.setPackageScanClassResolver(jbossResolver);
{code} 

h3. Using with Spring XML

When using Spring XML its just a matter of defining a spring bean with the JBoss class resolver as shown:

{code:xml}
   <bean id="jbossResolver" class="org.apache.camel.jboss.JBossPackageScanClassResolver"/>

  <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="seda:start"/>
      <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>
{code}

h3. Dependencies

You need to get the component from the [Camel Extra|http://camel-extra.googlecode.com/] project as JBoss uses *LPGL* license which cannot be hosted at Apache.
