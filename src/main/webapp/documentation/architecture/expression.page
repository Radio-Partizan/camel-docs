h2. Expressions

To support dynamic rules Camel supports pluggable [Expression|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Expression.html] strategies using a variety of different [Languages].

Expressions and [Predicates|Predicate] can then be used to create the various [Enterprise Integration Patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] in the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration] like the [Recipient List].

If you are outside of the [DSL] and want to create your own expressions you can either implement the [Expression interface|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Expression.html], reuse one of the other builders or try the [ExpressionBuilder class|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/builder/ExpressionBuilder.html].
