h2. JNDI

Camel will use JNDI as the default [Registry] implementation if you do not use [Spring]. This means that using a DefaultCamelContext will try and create a [JndiRegistry|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/JndiRegistry.html] which uses the JNDI InitialContext as the registry.

This means you need to configure some JNDI provider to be able to use this. This is described in this [FAQ entry|Exception - javax.naming.NoInitialContextException], but essentially you just need to create a file called *jndi.properties* on the classpath and configure it with the JNDI provider you wish.

You can use the Camel JNDI provider by using the following *jndi.properties* file

{code}
java.naming.factory.initial = org.apache.camel.util.jndi.CamelInitialContextFactory
{code}
