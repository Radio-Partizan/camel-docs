h2. Serialization

Serialization is a [Data Format] which uses the standard Java Serialization mechanism to unmarshal a binary payload into Java objects or to marshal Java objects into a binary blob.
 For example the following uses Java serialization to unmarshal a binary file then send it as an ObjectMessage to [ActiveMQ]

{code}
from("file://foo/bar").
  unmarshal().serialization().
  to("activemq:Some.Queue");
{code}
