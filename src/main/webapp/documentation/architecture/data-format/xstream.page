h2. XStream

XStream is a [Data Format] which uses the [XStream library|http://xstream.codehaus.org/] to marshal and unmarshal Java objects to and from XML.

{code}
// lets turn Object messages into XML then send to MQSeries
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  marshal().xstream().
  to("mqseries:Another.Queue");
{code}

h3. XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory 
[The XStream library|http://xstream.codehaus.org/] uses the {{javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory}} and {{javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory}},  you can control which implementation of this factory should be used.

The Factory is discovered using this algorithm:
1. Use the {{javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory}} , {{javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory}} system property.
2. Use the {{lib/xml.stream.properties}} file in the {{JRE_HOME}} directory.
3. Use the Services API, if available, to determine the classname by looking in the {{META-INF/services/javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory}}, {{META-INF/services/javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory}}  files in jars available to the JRE.
4. Use the platform default XMLInputFactory,XMLOutputFactory instance.

h3. How to set the XML encoding in Xstream DataFormat?
From Camel 1.6.3 or Camel 2.2.0, you can set the encoding of XML in Xstream DataFormat by setting the Exchange's property with the key {{Exchange.CHARSET_NAME}}, or setting the encoding property on Xstream from DSL or Spring config.
{code}
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  marshal().xstream("UTF-8").
  to("mqseries:Another.Queue");
{code}

h3. Dependencies

To use XStream in your camel routes you need to add the a dependency on *camel-xstream* which implements this data format. 

If you use maven you could just add the following to your pom.xml, substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see [the download page for the latest versions|Download]).

{code}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-xstream</artifactId>
  <version>1.5.0</version>
</dependency>
{code}
