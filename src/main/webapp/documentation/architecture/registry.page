h2. Registry

Camel supports a pluggable [Registry|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spi/Registry.html] plugin strategy. This allows Camel to easily work with some kind of registry like

* [SimpleRegistry|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/SimpleRegistry.html] which is a simple {{java.util.Map}} based registry.
* [JndiRegistry|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/JndiRegistry.html] which uses the [JNDI] InitialContext as the registry
* [ApplicationContextRegistry|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-spring/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spring/spi/ApplicationContextRegistry.html] if you are using Spring, it uses the ApplicationContext as the registry

You can also access the Registry from the [CamelContext] via the [camelContext.getRegistry() method|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html#getRegistry()]
