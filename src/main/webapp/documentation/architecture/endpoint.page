h2. Endpoints

{excerpt}Camel supports the [Message Endpoint] pattern using the [Endpoint|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html] interface. Endpoints are usually created by a [Component] and Endpoints are usually referred to in the [DSL] via their [URIs]. 

From an Endpoint you can use the following methods
* [createProducer()|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer()] will create a [Producer|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Producer.html] for sending message exchanges to the endpoint
* [createConsumer()|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer(org.apache.camel.Processor)] implements the [Event Driven Consumer] pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a [Processor|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html] when creating a [Consumer|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html] 
* [createPollingConsumer()|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer()] implements the [Polling Consumer] pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a [PollingConsumer|http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/PollingConsumer.html]
