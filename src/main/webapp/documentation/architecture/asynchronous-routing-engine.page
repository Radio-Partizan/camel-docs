h2. Asynchronous Routing Engine
*Available as of Camel 2.4*

As of Camel 2.4 the asynchronous routing engine is back and kicking.
All the [Enterprise Integration Patterns] is supported as well a selected number of [Components]:
- [JBI] (both consumer and producer)
- [NMR] (both consumer and producer)
- [Jetty] (both consumer and producer)
- [Netty] (only producer)
- [CXF] *Camel 2.5:* (both consumer and producer)
- [CXFRS] *Camel 2.5:* (only consumer)
- [JMS] *Camel 2.5:* (only producer for [Request Reply] messaging over JMS)

When we say a component is supported, that means, the component is leveraging the asynchronous model. For example [Jetty] uses continuations and the async http client to be fully asynchronous and non blocked. That means no threads will ever be blocked while waiting for a reply.

In the future additional [Components] will be supported as well where it's applicable.

h3. Forcing to use synchronous processing

You can configure the endpoints with the option {{synchronous=true}} to force using synchronous processing. For example when sending a web service request using [CXF], the caller will wait for the reply, if {{synchronous=true}} was configured. Currently this option is supported by the producers only. The [JBI] and [NMR] component is always asynchronous and doesn't support this option.

h2. Background information

See [Asynchronous Processing] for additional information and the concepts behind the asynchronous model.
