{tip}This page is work in progress. The layering is probably not yet correct{tip}

Camel-core is the basic module of apache camel. It contains the public API and the Java DSL and several implementation packages.

The most important packages are:
|| Package Name || Description ||
| builder | The Camel Domain Specific Language for creating Routes, Predicates, Expressions and Error Handlers |
| model | Contains the classes (*Type) that form the java DSL. The central class is the RouteBuilder |
| language | Language APIs and plugins for Expressions and Predicates |
| component | Some simple components like bean or log. You will find most components in the other camel modules |
| impl | Implementation classes for model and camel |
| processor | Processors to implement the Enterprise Integration Patterns |
| spi | Service provider interfaces. Strategy APIs for implementors to extend Camel |
| camel | Base package for camel. Defintions like Message and CamelContext can be found there |

h1. Architecture Diagram

The diagram shows the (relaxed) layering of the top level packages in camel-core. Relaxed means that a layer may reference any layer below it.!architecture.png!

h1. Architecture Diagram including current violations&nbsp;

Each arrow upwards shows a violation in the layering. That means some class inside the package references a class of a package above it. These diagrams were built with an architecture tool called structure 101. We have an offer from the manufacturer headway software to supply us with licenses for all camel developers that are interested. If you want a license please contact me (Christian Schneider chris at die-schneider.net). I will then try to organize a license for you.
