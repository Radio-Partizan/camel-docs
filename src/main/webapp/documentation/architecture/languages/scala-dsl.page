{warning:title=Work in progress}
The Scala DSL for Apache Camel is currently under development and it only supports part of what is available in the Java-based [DSL] or [Xml Configuration] syntax.

h3. About the Scala DSL
[Scala|http://www.scala-lang.org/] is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.  It integrates very well with the Java platform.  Our Scala DSL implementation is built on top of the existing Java-based [DSL], but it adds Scala syntax sugar to make building routes even more convenient.

h3. Documentation
* [Scala DSL - Getting Started] gives you basic information on how to use the Scala DSL.
* [Scala DSL - EIP] shows you the Scala DSL syntax for every EIP supported
* [Scala DSL - Supported languages] explains the usage of traits to add support for other languages (e.g. XPath)

h3. References
* At [ApacheCon Europe 2008|http://www.eu.apachecon.com] there was a Fast Feather talk that introduced some of the basic Scala language concepts that are being used for building the Scala DSL.  [Here are the presentation slides| http://www.anova.be/files/camel-scala.pdf] .
