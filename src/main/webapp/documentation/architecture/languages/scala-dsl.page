{warning:title=Work in progress}
The Scala DSL for Apache Camel is currently under development and it only supports part of what is available in the Java-based [DSL] or [Xml Configuration] syntax.
{warning}

h3. About the Scala DSL
[Scala|http://www.scala-lang.org/] is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.  It integrates very well with the Java platform.  Our Scala DSL implementation is built on top of the existing Java-based [DSL], but it adds Scala syntax sugar to make building routes even more convenient.

h3. Documentation
* [Scala DSL - Getting Started] gives you basic information on how to use the Scala DSL.
* [Scala DSL - EIP] shows you the Scala DSL syntax for every EIP supported
* [Scala DSL - Supported languages] explains the usage of traits to add support for other languages (e.g. XPath)

h3. References
* At [ApacheCon Europe 2008|http://www.eu.apachecon.com] there was a Fast Feather talk that introduced some of the basic Scala language concepts that are being used for building the Scala DSL.  [Here are the presentation slides| http://www.anova.be/files/camel-scala.pdf] .

h3. Dependencies

To use the Scala DSL in your camel routes you need to add the a dependency on *camel-scala* which implements the Scala DSL.

If you use maven you could just add the following to your pom.xml, substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see the download page for the latest versions).

{code:xml}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-scala</artifactId>
  <version>2.5.0</version>
</dependency>
{code}

Otherwise, you'll also need [Scala|http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.8.1/scala-library-2.8.1.jar]
