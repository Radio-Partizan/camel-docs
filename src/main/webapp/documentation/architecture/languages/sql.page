h2. SQL

The SQL support is added by [JoSQL|http://josql.sourceforge.net/] and is primarily used for performing SQL queries on in-memory objects. If you prefer to perform actual database queries then check out the [JPA] component.

To use SQL in your camel routes you need to add the a dependency on *camel-josql* which implements the SQL language. 

If you use maven you could just add the following to your pom.xml, substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see [the download page for the latest versions|Download]).

{code:xml}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-josql</artifactId>
  <version>2.5.0</version>
</dependency>
{code}

Camel supports [SQL|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL] to allow an [Expression] or [Predicate] to be used in the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration]. For example you could use SQL to create an [Predicate] in a [Message Filter] or as an [Expression] for a [Recipient List].

{code}
from("queue:foo").setBody().sql("select * from MyType").to("queue:bar")
{code}

And the spring DSL:
{code:xml}
   <from uri="queue:foo"/>
   <setBody>
       <sql>select * from MyType</sql>
   </setBody>
   <to uri="queue:bar"/>
{code}

h3. Variables

|| Variable || Type || Description ||
| exchange | Exchange | the Exchange object |
| in | Message | the exchange.in message |
| out | Message | the exchange.out message |
| the property key | Object | the Exchange properties |
| the header key | Object | the exchange.in headers |
| the variable key | Object | if any additional variables is added using {{setVariables}} method |
