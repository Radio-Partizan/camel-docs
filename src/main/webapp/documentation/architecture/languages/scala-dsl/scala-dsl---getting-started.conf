Just like the Java [DSL], the Scala DSL has a RouteBuilder ({{org.apache.camel.scala.builder.RouteBuilder}}) class that you have to extend to implement your own routes.  This example shows you two very simple routes.  
{snippet:id=basic|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-scala/src/test/scala/org/apache/camel/scala/dsl/BasicRouteBuilderTest.scala}

If you compare this to the Java [DSL], you notice:
* there is no configure() method to override
* a route starts directly with a URI instead of {{from(uri)}}
* {{&rarr;}} is just an alias for {{to}}
