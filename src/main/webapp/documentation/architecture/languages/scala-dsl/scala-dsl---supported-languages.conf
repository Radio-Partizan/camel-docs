Support for other languages inside Scala DSL routes is delivered through traits.  The {{org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.languages}} package currently offers traits to support XPath.  To use any given language, you can mix-in the trait when creating your {{RouteBuilder}} like this:
{snippet:id=xpath|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-scala/src/test/scala/org/apache/camel/scala/dsl/SplitterRouteBuilderTest.scala}

h4. Using [XPath]
With the XPath trait, you have an additional method available on an {{Exchange}} to do XPath queries against the message.  Just look at this Splitter example, where the {{xpath}} method is used in a {{Exchange &rArr; Any*}} function literal
{snippet:id=block|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-scala/src/test/scala/org/apache/camel/scala/dsl/SplitterRouteBuilderTest.scala}

h4. Using [JXPath]
With the {{org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.languages.JXPath}} trait, you can an additional {{jxpath}} method on the {{Exchange}}.  In the Recipient List example below, JXPath is used for getting the next endpoint's name out of the message body.
{snippet:id=block|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-scala/src/test/scala/org/apache/camel/scala/dsl/RecipientListRouteTest.scala}
