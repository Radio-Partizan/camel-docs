h2. BeanShell

Camel supports [BeanShell|http://www.beanshell.org/] among other [Scripting Languages] to allow an [Expression] or [Predicate] to be used in the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration].

To use a BeanShell expression use the following Java code:

{code}
...choice()
    .when(script("beanshell", "request.getHeaders().get(\"foo\").equals(\"bar\")"))
       .to("...")
{code}

Or the something like this in your Spring XML:

{code:xml}
<filter>
  <language language="beanshell">request.getHeaders().get("Foo") == null</language>
  ...
{code}

{note:title=BeanShell Issues}
You must use BeanShell 2.0b5 or greater.  Note that as of 2.0b5 BeanShell cannot compile scripts, which causes Camel releases before 2.6 to fail when configured with BeanShell expressions.
{note}

You could follow the examples above to create an [Predicate] in a [Message Filter] or as an [Expression] for a [Recipient List]
