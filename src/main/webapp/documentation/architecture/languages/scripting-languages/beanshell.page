h2. BeanShell

Camel supports [BeanShell|http://www.beanshell.org/] among other [Scripting Languages] to allow an [Expression] or [Predicate] to be used in the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration].

To use a BeanShell expression use the following Java code

{code}
... beanShell("someBeanShellExpression") ... 
{code}

For example you could use the *beanShell* function to create an [Predicate] in a [Message Filter] or as an [Expression] for a [Recipient List]
