h2. Mvel
*Avialable in Camel 2.0*

Camel allows [Mvel|http://mvel.codehaus.org/] to be used as an [Expression] or [Predicate] the [DSL] or [Xml Configuration].

You could use Mvel to create an [Predicate] in a [Message Filter] or as an [Expression] for a [Recipient List]

You can use Mvel dot notation to invoke operations. If you for instance have a body that contains a POJO that has a {{getFamiliyName}} method then you can construct the syntax as follows:
{code}
"request.body.familyName"
   // or 
"getRequest().getBody().getFamilyName()"
{code}

h3. Variables

|| Variable || Type || Description ||
| *this* | Exchange | the Exchange is the root object |
| exchange | Exchange | the Exchange object |
| exception | Throwable | the Exchange exception (if any) |
| exchangeId | String | the exchange id |
| fault | Message | the Fault message (if any) |
| request | Message | the exchange.in message |
| response | Message | the exchange.out message (if any) |
| properties | Map | the exchange properties |
| property(name) | Object | the property by the given name |
| property(name, type) | Type | the property by the given name as the given type |

h3. Samples
For example you could use Mvel inside a [Message Filter] in XML

{code}
<route>
  <from uri="seda:foo"/>
  <filter>
    <mvel>request.headers.foo == 'bar'</mvel>
    <to uri="seda:bar"/>
  </filter>
</route>
{code}

And the sample using Java DSL:
{code:java}
   from("seda:foo").filter().mvel("request.headers.foo == 'bar'").to("seda:bar");
{code}

h3. Dependencies

To use Mvel in your camel routes you need to add the a dependency on *camel-mvel* which implements the Mvel language. 

If you use maven you could just add the following to your pom.xml, substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see [the download page for the latest versions|Download]).

{code}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-mvel</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
{code}

Otherwise, you'll also need [MVEL|http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/mvel/mvel2/2.0.18/mvel2-2.0.18.jar]
