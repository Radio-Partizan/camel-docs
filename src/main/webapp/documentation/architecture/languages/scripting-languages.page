h2. Scripting Languages

Camel supports a number of scripting languages which can be used to create an [Expression] or [Predicate] via the standard [JSR 223|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223] which is a standard part of Java 6. 

The following scripting languages are integrated into the DSL:
||Language||DSL keyword||
|EL|{{el}}|
|Groovy|{{groovy}}|
|JavaScript|{{javaScript}}|
|JoSQL|{{sql}}|
|JXPath|{{jxpath}}|
|MVEL|{{mvel}}|
|OGNL|{{ognl}}|
|PHP|{{php}}|
|Python|{{python}}|
|Ruby|{{ruby}}|
|XPath|{{xpath}}|
|XQuery|{{xquery}}|


However any [JSR 223|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223] scripting language can be used using the generic DSL methods.
