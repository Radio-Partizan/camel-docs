h2. Scripting Languages

Camel supports a number of scripting languages which can be used to create an [Expression] or [Predicate] via the standard [JSR 223|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223] which is a standard part of Java 6. 

The following scripting languages are integrated into the DSL:
* [BeanShell]
* [JavaScript]
* [Groovy]
* [Python] 
* [PHP]
* [Ruby]

However any [JSR 223|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223] scripting language can be used using the generic DSL methods.
