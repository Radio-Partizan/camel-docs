h2. Property Expression Language

The Property Expression Language allows you to extract values of named exchange properties.

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

h3. Example usage

The recipientList element of the Spring DSL can utilize a property expression like: 

{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/recipientListWithStringDelimitedProperty.xml}

In this case, the list of recipients are contained in the property 'myProperty'. 

And the same example in Java DSL:

{snippet:id=example|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/RecipientListWithStringDelimitedPropertyTest.java}

And with a slightly different syntax where you use the builder to the fullest (i.e. avoid using parameters but using stacked operations, notice that property is not a parameter but a stacked method call)
{code:java}
  from("direct:a").recipientList().property("myProperty");
{code}

h3. Dependencies
The Property language is part of *camel-core*.
