h2. Tutorial - camel-example-reportincident


h2. Introduction

Creating this tutorial was inspired by a real life use-case I discussed over the phone with a colleague. He was working at a client whom uses a heavy-weight integration platform from a very large vendor. He was in talks with developer shops to implement a new integration on this platform. His trouble was the shop tripled the price when they realized the platform of choice. So I was wondering how we could do this integration with Camel. Can it be done, without tripling the cost ;).

This tutorial is written during the development of the integration. I have decided to start off with a sample that isn't Camel's but standard Java and then plugin Camel as we goes. Just as when people needed to learn Spring you could consume it piece by piece, the same goes with Camel.

The target reader is person whom hasn't experience or just started using Camel.

h2. Motivation for this tutorial

I wrote this tutorial motivated as Camel lacked an example application that was based on the web application deployment model. The entire world hasn't moved to pure OSGi deployments yet.

h2. The use-case

The goal is to allow staff to report incidents into a central administration. For that they use client software where they report the incident and submit it to the central administration. As this is an integration in a transition phase the administration should get these incidents by email whereas they are manually added to the database. The client software should gather the incident and submit the information to the integration platform that in term will transform the report into an email and send it to the central administrator for manual processing.

The figure below illustrates this process. The end users reports the incidents using the client applications. The incident is sent to the central integration platform as webservice. The integration platform will process the incident and send an OK acknowledgment back to the client. Then the integration will transform the message to an email and send it to the administration mail server. The users in the administration will receive the emails and take it from there.

h3. In EIP patterns

We distill the use case as [EIP|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com] patterns:

h2. Parts

This tutorial is divided into sections and parts:

*Section A: Existing Solution, how to slowly use Camel*

Part 1 - This first part explain how to setup the project and get a webservice exposed using [Apache CXF|http://cxf.apache.org/]. In fact we don't touch Camel yet.

Part 2 - Now we are ready to introduce Camel piece by piece (without using Spring or any XML configuration file) and create the full feature integration. This part will introduce different Camel's concepts and How we can build our solution using them like :
- CamelContext
- Endpoint, Exchange & Producer
- Components : Log, File

Part 3 - Continued from part 2 where we implement that last part of the solution with the event driven consumer and how to send the email through the Mail component.

*Section B: The Camel Solution*

Part 4 - We now turn into the path of Camel where it excels - the routing.
Part 5 - Is about how embed Camel with Spring and using [CXF] endpoints directly in Camel

{tip:title=Using Axis 2}
See this blog entry by Sagara demonstrating how to use [Apache Axis 2|http://ws.apache.org/axis2/] instead of [Apache CXF|http://cxf.apache.org/] as the web service framework.
