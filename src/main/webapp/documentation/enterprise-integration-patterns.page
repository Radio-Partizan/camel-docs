h2. Enterprise Integration Patterns

Camel supports most of the [Enterprise Integration Patterns|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/toc.html] from the excellent book by [Gregor Hohpe|http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/105-9796798-8100401?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Gregor%20Hohpe] and [Bobby Woolf|http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/105-9796798-8100401?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Bobby%20Woolf]. 

If you are new to Camel you might want to try the [Getting Started] in the [User Guide] before attempting to implement these patterns.

The EIP icons library is available as a Visio stencil file adapted to render the icons with the Camel color : sand. Download it [here|http://cwiki.apache.org/CAMEL/enterprise-integration-patterns.data/Hohpe_EIP_camel.zip] for your presentation, functional and technical analysis documents. The original EIP stencil is also available in [OpenOffice 3.x Draw|^Hohpe_EIP_camel_OpenOffice.zip] (thanks to Marco Garbelini) , [Microsoft Visio|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/download/EIP_Visio_stencil.zip], or [Omnigraffle|http://www.graffletopia.com/stencils/137].
