h2. Creating a new Spring based Camel Route

If you want to create your own version of the [Spring Example] you can use the maven archetype.

{code}
mvn archetype:generate                   \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes  \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-spring   \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.5.0             \
  -DgroupId=myGroupId                  \
  -DartifactId=myArtifactId   
{code}

*Note*: -DarchetypeVersion=1.5.0 is the version number of Camel. Change this to the current version of Camel you are using.

{info}
When using camel archetypes, make sure your package name is not org.apache.camel (or a sub package of this) as this will instruct Camel to search in its own packages for your routes. This can also cause Camel not to start, as shown in CAMEL-1197. You can change your package name by specifying -Dpackage
{info}

This will create a maven project which can be run immediately via the [Camel Maven Plugin] as follows

{code}
cd myArtifactId
mvn camel:run
{code}

The configuration file is in *src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-context.xml*. 

The routing rules lives at *src/main/java/myGroupId/MyRouteBuilder.java*
