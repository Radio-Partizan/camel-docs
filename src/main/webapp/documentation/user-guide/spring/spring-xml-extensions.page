The Camel [Spring XML Extensions] allow you use a very concise XML syntax to describe your Camel configuration when you are using spring to wire together your application.
The following is an example of what it looks like:

{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/xml/buildSimpleRouteWithChoice.xml}
