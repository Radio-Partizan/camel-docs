h2. Creating a new Camel Component

If you want to create your own version of the [Camel Component] you can use the maven archetype.

{code}
mvn archetype:create                   \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes  \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-component \
  -DarchetypeVersion=2.2.0  \
  -DgroupId=myGroupId                  \
  -DartifactId=myArtifactId   
{code}

This will create a maven project which contains a demo component, you need to implements your own component by modifying it.You need to move the META-INF/services/direct file to META-INF/services/PACKAGE_NAME/FOO where FOO is the URI scheme for your component and any related endpoints created on the fly and PACKAGE_NAME is your component's package name which is replaced the '.' with '/'.
