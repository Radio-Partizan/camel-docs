h3. Bean Injection

We support the injection of various resources using @EndpointInject. This can be used to inject

* [Endpoint] instances which can be used for testing when used with [Mock] endpoints; see the [Spring Testing] for an example.
* [ProducerTemplate] instances for [POJO Producing]
* client side proxies for [POJO Producing] which is a simple approach to [Spring Remoting]
