h2. camel:dot

The *camel:dot* goal of the [Camel Maven Plugin] is used to generate [Visualisation] diagrams for your [Enterprise Integration Patterns].
It works like [camel:embedded|Camel Embedded Maven Goal], it will boot up your [Spring] configuration but it will only keep up for a few seconds. This will then generate a [GraphViz|http://graphviz.org] DOT file in _target/site/cameldoc_.

The plugin will then try and convert the DOT file into a HTML, PNG and SVG representation. To do this an installation of [GraphViz|http://graphviz.org] is required to be on your PATH.

So to use this plugin, please [download Graphviz|http://graphviz.org/Download..php] then put it on your PATH.

By default the plugin will evaluate the _dot_ executable, but you can overload this by configuring the plugin's executable property. e.g.

{code}
<configuration>
 <executable>DOT.EXE</executable>
</configuration>
{code}

h3. Trying out camel:dot

A good example application to get you started is the [Spring Example].

{code}
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn compile camel:dot
{code}

Your generated PNG/SVG files will then be in the _target/site/cameldoc_ directory - assuming Maven could find your DOT executable.

Note that you do not need to explicitly run this goal; you could just [integrate this plugin into the normal Maven report generation|Camel Maven Plugin].

h3. Disabling execution of DOT executable

In Camel 1.4 you can disable the execution of DOT by setting the useDot configuration parameter to false.
