h2. camel:run

The *camel:run* goal of the [Camel Maven Plugin] is used to run your Camel [Spring] configurations in a forked JVM from Maven. A good example application to get you started is the [Spring Example].

{code}
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn camel:run
{code}

This makes it very easy to spin up and test your routing rules without having to write a main(String[]) method; it also lets you create multiple jars to host different sets of routing rules and easily test them independently.

How this works is that the plugin will compile the source code in the maven project, then boot up a Spring ApplicationContext using the XML confiuration files on the classpath at

{code}
META-INF/spring/*.xml
{code}

This allows you to boot up any Spring services you wish; whether they are Camel related or any other Spring POJOs.

If you want to boot up your Camel routes a little faster, you could try the [camel:embedded|Camel Embedded Maven Goal] instead.

h3. About DOT generation
{{camel:run}} will by default try to run dot generation to generate [Visualisation] diagrams.
This feature could in some rare cases cause the application to hang, so its by default disabled in Camel 1.6.1 or newer.

To enable it you should configure the *useDot* parameter:
{code}
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <useDot>true</useDot>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>    
{code}
