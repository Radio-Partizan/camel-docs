The *camel:embedded* goal of the [Camel Maven Plugin] is used to run your Camel [Spring] configurations in the same JVM as Maven, so it should startup a bit faster than [camel:run|Camel Run Maven Goal]. Though sometimes we all get the odd classpath issue; so sometimes forking a new JVM can work around any strange Maven classpath issues.

A good example application to get you started is the [Spring Example].

{code}
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn camel:embedded
{code}
