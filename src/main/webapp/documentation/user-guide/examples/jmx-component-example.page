h2. JMX Component Example

*Available as of Camel 2.6*

The example is included in the distribution at {{examples/camel-example-jmx}}. It contains a {{README.txt}} file with details how to use and run it.

h3. The routes

This example has 2 routes:
1. A route that calls a update method on an MBean every 5th second. This is done using a timer endpoint.
2. A route that monitors the MBean using the jmx-component. When the first route fires it causes the MBean to update and send out a notification
event. This route subscribes to that MBean and receives any JMX notification events. Events are then just sent to the log endpoint.

h3. Usage
You can use maven to run the example using
{code}
mvn camel:run
{code}


It takes about 10 second before Camel logs to the screen the first time. Its should be like this
{code}
2010-11-17 08:01:09,755 [foo            ] INFO  jmxEvent                       - Exchange[ExchangePattern:InOnly, BodyType:String,
