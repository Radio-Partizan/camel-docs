h2. {{gtask}} Component

The {{gtask}} component contributes to the [Camel Components for Google App Engine|GAE] (GAE). It supports asynchronous message processing on GAE by using the [task queueing service|http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/] as message queue. For adding messages to a queue it uses the task queue API. For receiving messages from a queue it installs an HTTP callback handler. The handler is called by an HTTP POST callback (a [web hook|http://www.webhooks.org/]) initiated by the task queueing service. Whenever a new task is added to a queue a callback will be sent. The {{gtask}} component abstracts from these details and supports endpoint URIs that make message queueing on GAE as easy as message queueing with [JMS] or [SEDA].

h3. URI format

{code}
gtask://queue-name
{code}

h3. Options

|| Name || Default Value || Context || Description ||
| {{workerRoot}} | {{worker}} | Producer | The servlet mapping for callback handlers. By default, this component requires a callback servlet mapping of {{/worker/\*}}. If another servlet mapping is used e.g. {{/myworker/\*}} it must be set as option on the producer side: {{to("gtask:myqueue?workerRoot=myworker")}}.|
| {{inboundBindingRef}} | reference to {{GTaskBinding}} | Consumer |Reference to an {{InboundBinding<GTaskEndpoint, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse>}} in the [Registry] for customizing the binding of an {{Exchange}} to the Servlet API. The referenced binding is used as post-processor to {{org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpBinding}}.|
| {{outboundBindingRef}} | reference to {{GTaskBinding}} | Producer |Reference to an {{OutboundBinding<GTaskEndpoint, TaskOptions, void>}} in the [Registry] for customizing the binding of an {{Exchange}} to the task queueing service.|

On the consumer-side, all options of the [Servlet component|SERVLET] are supported.

h3. Message headers

On the consumer-side all headers of the [Servlet component|SERVLET] component are supported plus the following.

|| Name || Type || Context || Description ||
| {{GTaskBinding.GTASK_QUEUE_NAME}} | {{String}} | Consumer | Name of the task queue.|
| {{GTaskBinding.GTASK_TASK_NAME}} | {{String}} | Consumer | Name of the task (generated value).|
| {{GTaskBinding.GTASK_RETRY_COUNT}} | {{int}} | Consumer |  Number of callback retries.|

h3. Message body

On the producer side the {{in}} message body is converted to a {{byte[]}} and is POSTed to the callback handler as content-type {{application/octet-stream}}.

h3. Usage

Setting up tasks queues is an administrative task on Google App Engine. Only one queue is pre-configured and can be referenced by name out-of-the-box: the {{default}} queue. This queue will be used in the following examples. Please note that when using task queues on the local development server, tasks must be executed manually from the [developer console|http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview.html#Task_Queues_and_the_Development_Server].

h4. Default queue 

{code:java}
...
.to(gtask:default) // add message to default queue

from(gtask:default) // receive message from default queue (via a web hook)
...
{code}

This example requires the following servlet mapping.

{code:xml|title=web.xml}
    ...
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>CamelServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.apache.camel.component.servlet.CamelHttpTransportServlet</servlet-class>
        ...
    </servlet>
    ...
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>CamelServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/worker/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    ...
{code}

h3. Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their {{pom.xml}}. 

{code:xml|title=pom.xml}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-gae</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
{code}

where {{$\{camel-version\}}} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel (2.1.0 or higher).
