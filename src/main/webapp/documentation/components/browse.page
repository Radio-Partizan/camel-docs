h2. Browse Component

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

The Browse component provides a simple [BrowsableEndpoint] which can be useful for testing, visualisation tools or debugging. The exchanges sent to the endpoint are all available to be browsed.


h3. URI format

{code}
browse:someName
{code}

Where *someName* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint.

h3. Sample
In the route below, we insert a {{browse:}} component to be able to browse the Exchanges that are passing through:
{code:java}
  from("activemq:order.in").to("browse:orderReceived").to("bean:processOrder");
{code}

We can now inspect the received exchanges from within the Java code:

{code:java}
    private CamelContext context;

    public void inspectRecievedOrders() {
        BrowsableEndpoint browse = context.getEndpoint("browse:orderReceived", BrowsableEndpoint.class);
        List<Exchange> exchanges = browse.getExchanges();
        ...
        // then we can inspect the list of received exchanges from Java
        for (Exchange exchange : exchanges) {
            String payload = exchange.getIn().getBody();
            ...
        }
   }
{code}
