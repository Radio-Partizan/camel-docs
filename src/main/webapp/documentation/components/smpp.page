h2. SMPP Component
*Available as of Camel 2.2*

This component provides access to an SMSC (Short Message Service Center) over the [SMPP|http://smsforum.net/SMPP_v3_4_Issue1_2.zip] protocol to send and receive SMS. The [JSMPP|http://code.google.com/p/jsmpp/] is used.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their {{pom.xml}} for this component:
{code:xml}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-smpp</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
{code}

h3. URI format

{code}
smpp://[username@]hostname[:port][?options]
smpps://[username@]hostname[:port][?options]
{code}

If no *username* is provided, then Camel will provide the default value {{smppclient}}.
If no *port* number is provided, then Camel will provide the default value {{2775}}.
*Camel 2.3:* If the protocol name is "smpps", camel-smpp with try to use SSLSocket to init a connection to the server.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format, {{?option=value&option=value&...}}
