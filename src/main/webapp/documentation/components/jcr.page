h2. JCR Component

The *{{jcr}}* component allows you to add nodes to a JCR (JSR-170) compliant content repository (for example, [Apache Jackrabbit | http://jackrabbit.apache.org/]).

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their {{pom.xml}} for this component:
{code}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jcr</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
{code}

h3. URI format

{code}
jcr://user:password@repository/path/to/node
{code}

h3. Usage
The {{repository}} element of the URI is used to look up the JCR {{Repository}} object in the Camel context registry.

If a message is sent to a JCR producer endpoint:
* A new node is created in the content repository,
* All the message properties of the IN message are transformed to JCR {{Value}} instances and added to the new node,
* The node's UUID is returned in the OUT message.

h3. Message properties
All message properties are converted to node properties, except for the {{CamelJcrNodeName}} property (you can refer to {{JcrConstants.NODE_NAME}} in your code), which is used to determine the node name.

h3. Example
The snippet below creates a node named {{node}} under the {{/home/test}} node in the content repository.  One additional attribute is added to the node as well: {{my.contents.property}} which will contain the body of the message being sent.
