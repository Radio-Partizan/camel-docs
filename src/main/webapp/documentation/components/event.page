h2. Event Component

The *event:* component provides access to the Spring ApplicationEvent objects. This allows you to publish ApplicationEvent objects to a Spring ApplicationContext or to consume them. You can then use [Enterprise Integration Patterns] to process them such as [Message Filter].

h3. URI format

{code}
spring-event://default
{code}

If you use Camel 1.x then you may need to remove the // to get it working with the Spring event notification
{code}
spring-event:default
{code}
