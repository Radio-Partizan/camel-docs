h2. JBI Service Unit Archetype

If you want to spin up your own project to use Camel to perform some smart routing inside your JBI based ESB you can use the Maven archtetype to get up to speed quickly.

Just type the following into a console...

{code}
mvn archetype:create                           \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel          \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-jbi-service-unit \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT              \
  -DgroupId=myGroupId                          \
  -DartifactId=myArtifactId   
{code}

This will create a maven project which can be run immediately via the [Camel Maven Plugin] as follows

{code}
cd myArtifactId
mvn install
{code}

The configuration file is in *src/main/resources/camel-context.xml*. 

The routing rules lives at *src/main/java/myGroupId/MyRouteBuilder.java*
